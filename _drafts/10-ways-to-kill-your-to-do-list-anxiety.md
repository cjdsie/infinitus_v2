It’s the worst feeling: you have a million and three things to do. You’re stuck in a tailspin of checking your email. You haven’t crossed anything off of your list... yet. You feel your stress level rising higher. You almost feel paralyzed to start, even though you know that with every minute that ticks by, you get further behind.

Have you felt that powerlessness? It can be difficult to push through.

For me, my loss of productivity is almost always from one of these things:

1. What I need to do is not clearly defined or is something I haven’t done often before. I’m not even sure where to start and I’m not sure I can start. (With me, this is the case 75% of the time.) 
2. I feel like I’m letting someone down, so I put off replying or reacting. (I find myself dealing with this one 5% of the time.)
3. I genuinely don’t like the task. (Again, this happens about 10% of the time.)
4. I don’t feel well. Either I didn’t get enough sleep, feel sick, or am low on energy. (5% of the time, again.)

Take a minute and think about the source of resistance when you start procrastinating. What stops you from tearing through your to do list? Then, use some of my personal techniques for beating the to do list blues.


- Has a specific item on your list stopped you in your tracks? Recognize which one it is and press on -- do it first. You’ll feel much lighter afterwards. 
- Reward yourself with a task that you like after you finish the one you don’t want to do.
- If you’re running low on energy, schedule time to take care of yourself. Eat a healthy lunch, take an afternoon workout break, take a cat nap, meditate, or drink water. Take care of yourself so that you are able to tackle your tasks. You’ll be much more productive if you are trying to be “on” 24/7.
- If you really do have more things on your to do list than you have time for, you have two options: find someone to delegate to (hire someone or contract a virtual assistant) or manage expectations with your employees and stakeholders.
- If you have to do something repeatedly, is there a system you could implement that would make the task easier for you? 
- Can’t let go of a new idea that isn’t related to what you need to get done? Find a way to get it out of your head and save it for a later time. Designate a notebook, Evernote, or a piece of scrap paper to write down your brilliant ideas. Come back to it after your urgent work is done. 
- Build time into your schedule for “inspiration fueling” activities like attending industry events, learning new skills, or soaking in inspiration (reading magazines, watching popular TV shows, playing video games, travel, etc.) Know what fuels you and where your best ideas come from. If you consistently get great business ideas when you are working out, shouldn’t you do that every day?
- If you find yourself spending too much time in meetings, try to schedule them strategically. For example, as much as I love our podcast recordings, I know that they draw energy so we’ve switched to scheduling them all in one day. Are you leading the meetings? Tighten up your agenda and make sure that you keep the meeting on-task. Redirect participants who seem to lose focus or go on tangents.
- Is email eating up your day? Schedule email checking and response time into your day. Don’t let yourself do it as a filler activity-- you’ll waste time if you do. 
- Figure out exactly what activities lead to revenue generation. Whatever those activities are, make time for them. Don’t feel guilty about doing them… they’re the lifeline of your organization.

Remember, you are as powerful as you allow yourself to be… and as powerless as you allow yourself to be. Take a break from your work and come back to it in a few minutes, dedicated to starting over and being better. When in doubt, get started on any task on your list-- you’ll build momentum and enjoy the feeling of checking something off.
