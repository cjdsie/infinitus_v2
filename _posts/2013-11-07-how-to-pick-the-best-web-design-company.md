If you are in the market for an interactive agency for web design or development, we’ve compiled a list of important questions you need to ask to choose the best one. These work for any type of interactive project: including mobile websites, eCommerce, social media and search engine marketing and strategy.

Being an web design company ourselves, we know exactly what we would look for if we needed to hire an outside company. We also have businesses and organizations approach us on a daily basis with questions - so we know what is important to you. Investing in your online marketing + technology is a big decision, so you want to make sure that you are getting the highest return on your investment and that you are comparing apples to apples. 

You can request information from companies that you are interested in using different formats including simplistic quotes or email exchanges to a formal request for proposals. We’ve found we get the best results to talk over a nice cup of coffee about the future and what it holds - you get the best sense on if the company is a good fit for yours, and if your work styles will mesh together.

###What should you look for in a web design agency?

**What Are Your Needs?** 

1. Take time to detail exactly what your goals and needs are. Clearly defining what will make the project a success will put you and your designer/developer on the same path.

2. Give as much detail and information about your company as possible when in the quote phase, including challenges that you are facing.
  
3. Even though budget is important, realize that working with a full-service interactive agency is an investment. If your budget is extremely tight, you may need to pursue other DIY solutions, or save for a later date.

**The Agency**

1. What is their track record? Take a look at their portfolio and who they supply for references. Do you like their work? Do they have a variety of samples? Have they worked in your industry before?

2. Take a look behind the scenes at how their website ranks on an online tool such as [Open Site Explorer](http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/).
 
3. Search their client work online, see how it performs compared to competitors

4. See if they practice what they preach. Look at their website, social media accounts and blog: are there any problems or issues? Are they active online or just keeping the status quo? 

5. Check out their team. Are they are well-rounded with both marketing and technology team members, or just one or the other? 

**The Product**

1. Are you going to have a customized template or a full process driven website? 

2. Is your website on open source software? Do you own the site yourself? Or is it a custom content management system or closed source such as Wordpress or Joomla? [Our agency doesn’t use Wordpress](http://goinfinitus.com/myposts/we-dont-use-wordpress).

3. What are the management costs, support costs and overages? 

4. Are you required to host on-site or off-site and do they manage the details? 

5. What is their reaction when you ask them about SEO, SEM and SMM? 

6. Are you expected to give all content or do they edit and rewrite for improved SEO and conversion rates?

7. Are they going to test and optimize your site after the launch, and give you regular reports on the results? 

8. It’s important that user interface, technology and marketing all come together. Will the website be just a brochure or an immersive experience? Hint - you want the latter! 

**Gut Feeling**
Your gut is typically right, we always follow our guts and you should too. Overall, your personal relationship with web development agency is important.
