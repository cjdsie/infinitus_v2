In this edition of the Limitless Business Podcast, Scott Oldford and Kaye Putnam from [@GoInfinitus](http://twitter.com/goinfinitus)  chat to three great guests on three different subjects; but all of them tie back to one central theme: that your company culture is key to your marketing strategy.

Chris Da Sie gives advice on getting started with your company website/redesign.
Terry Hussey shows that adopting digital marketing techniques can be successful no matter what industry you work in.
Alison Stoodley share her thoughts on your company’s social media strategy and the best way to outsource it (if you really must!).

**In the interview with Chris Da Sie you’ll learn (amongst other things…):**
  
- Before designing your website you should plan and create your content.
- Be sure of your brand image and brand strategy before your web design.
- 3 key questions: What is the product for? What is the benefit to the user? What impression do you want to leave people with?
- Make your site responsive so it’s accessible to all, make it easy to use and have concise copy throughout with a consistent tone of voice.
- Think of your website as another employee; your proudest employee that never sleeps. It’s then easier to give your company personality.
- Translate the culture of your company into the site with copy, font, colours, so it’s an extension of your culture.
- Focus on the small steps, the tiny building blocks that make up your site: it’ll make your life easier and create a better site.

**In the interview with Terry Hussey you’ll discover:**
  
- How to move forward your marketing strategy to draw people to your business when your industry is very much based on relationship and word of mouth marketing historically.
- How to use your website to attract not just potential clients, but potential employees.
- How your company culture should be part of your mission statement.
- Portraying your culture through your website and social media makes you appear genuine and create trust in your brand.
- Content marketing can work in any industry, giving authority to your business and building relationships.
- If you’re a business in a small community, make yourself stand out by using these fresh marketing techniques and attitude towards business. If no one else is doing it, it will make a huge difference.

**In the interview with Alison Stoodley you’ll find that:**
  
- Using social media to find clients is not a ‘quick fix’, it takes time to build relationships and presence.
- Eventually social media can create loyal customers who do a lot of the marketing for you.
- Know who your target audience is so you know where they are and how to talk to them.
- The problem with outsourcing social media: it can stop being authentic and true to your brand.
- Think about keeping your social media in house, but hiring a consultant to look at your SM presence, train your staff and keep you up to date with developing platforms/techniques
- If you do outsource, you must still have a lot of input from the company itself, an outsourced SM contractor needs to understand your company culture.
- Understanding the company culture is key to building relationships on social media.
- Don’t be tempted to ‘sell’ via social media, it’s too easy for potential customers to turn you off.
- Give away your ‘secret sauce’, share your knowledge.
