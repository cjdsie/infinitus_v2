**95% of Facebook posts on a brand’s wall are left unanswered by their brand. (Source: Mindjumpers)**

Take a minute and think about that. Log into your business’ Facebook. Are there unanswered client posts on your wall? If there are, keep reading. This is for you.

Let’s go back to that 95%. Would you allows 95% of your business’ phone calls to go unanswered? What about 95% of your emails? What about 95% of your letters?

Of course not! Why? Because it’s bad business to ignore your clients. And you offer excellent customer service. Let’s get you into fighting shape with your Facebook page so that your online presence reflects your in-person presence.

**Answer On Time**<br>
Make sure that you’re keeping an eye on your brand’s Facebook page—at least daily. Set a time to answer any possible posts every day. Engaging with your clientele authentically and regularly demonstrates your interest in them—and they’ll be more likely to feel positively about your brand and service!

**Be Brief, But Informative**<br>
Don’t get into drawn-out conversations or arguments. If the issue is a bigger than a few sentences can answer, make sure that you offer your business’ email or phone number so that you can truly attend to the needs of your client. If the question is about a price, procedure, or product, give your client the answer along with any website resources that may be helpful. Avoid just pasting a website or phone number. That will give the impression that you can’t be bothered with their request. 

**Keep it Friendly and Personal**
Even if you think social media is a waste of time, don’t let on to your clients that you think it is. Keep a warm, engaging tone with your posts. Be personal—refer to the poster by first name and make sure to demonstrate that you’ve read their post, rather than offering a cookie-cutter response. If you’ve got an angry post that you must deal with, check out our suggestions on [how to do that](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/what-to-do-with-bad-reviews).
