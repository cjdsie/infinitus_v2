In this technology-driven age, creating content is arguably one of the most important things—if not the most important thing-- to do to improve your reach and expand your customer base.  Your content gets your audience the information they need to make informed decisions and purchases and demonstrates your authority on the subject. But if your audience won’t read what you’re creating, it’s all for nothing.

For many people, writing is a challenge and a chore. If that sounds like you, there are many things you can do to make your content interesting and engaging for your readers. Here are four heavy hitters that will pack an extra punch for you!

**Switch to active verbs.**
Remember active verbs from high school English? Use verbs that are energetic, colorful, and show action. Utilize active verbs to entice your audience to visualize what you’re describing or spur them to action. Get your creative juices flowing with this great list of active verbs ([http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~cainproj/writingtips/preciseverbs.html](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~cainproj/writingtips/preciseverbs.html))

**Choose your modifiers strategically.**
If you’ve ever picked up a menu at a trendy restaurant and read their description, you know exactly why strategic modifiers are important. They make your product sound irresistible and sexy to your consumers! Choose adjectives and adverbs that are unique and accurate.  After all, which is more salivation-worthy: a chocolate bar or a hand-dipped, caramel-infused chocolate bar?  Which would you rather put in your backyard: a pool or an infinity pool with handcrafted Venetian tiles?

**Make your choice the active voice.**
All writing happens in two voices: active or passive. Passive voice means that the subject of the sentence is receiving an action rather than doing the action. It is generally used to make difficult things sound less challenging and bad or to strategically remove agency from the subject.  Changing passive sentences to active ones usually shortens the sentence and makes the structure less confusing, in turn making it snappier and more palatable.

Look at this example of passive voice:
The antique’s authenticity and value will be shared with you before purchase.

The same sentence, but now in active voice:
We will share your antique’s authenticity and value with you before purchase.

**Cut the fat.**
By now, you know that by using action words, active voice, and modifiers, you can entice and delight your audience. Now you need to cut out the extra information and leave them with just the important stuff. Ask yourself these two questions to help you discern what you can eliminate:<br/>
· Does this help my audience make a decision or keep them entertained?<br/>
· Does this enhance or detract from my message?<br/>
 
Using these four strategies as you write will help you communicate more effectively with your audience. As you see them engage with your carefully crafted content—whether statuses, tweets, or blog posts—enjoy the connection and your ability to create community through your words! And then get back to writing—after all, your audience awaits your next post!
