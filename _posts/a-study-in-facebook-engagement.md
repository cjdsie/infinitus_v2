As we’ve discussed before, Facebook’s organic reach has been reportedly falling, so you’ll want to do what you can to increase your reach. To do that, you want to make sure that your fans are engaging with your page so that they’ll continue to see your posts.  Not sure where to start? That’s okay! Take a look at a few successful posts from our clients’ pages. Think about how you can translate these tips as statuses for your own brand.

**Include a Call to Action**<br/>
One of the best ways to create a response from your audience is to give them a call to action. What kind of action do you want them to take based on who your brand and audience are?  For [Remedy for Wellness](https://www.facebook.com/RemedyForWellness), business is all about health! It makes sense, then, for their call to action to be health-focused.  You’ll notice that just this one has 21 likes, 1 share, and 3 positive comments.  The ripple effect for this post is huge—the friends of each person who liked, commented, or shared were notified of their actions through Facebook’s newsfeed. That means a whole group of new potential clients for Remedy for Wellness.

**Start a Conversation**<br/>
Posing an intriguing question gets your audience talking and gives you valuable insights on what they enjoy… and don’t.  Take a gander at this explosive post for [Dawe’s Mechanical](https://www.facebook.com/DawesMechanical1981Ltd). Had the post just incorporated the picture of the fireplace, the engagement might not have been so visceral. By asking fans to weigh in, it started a dialogue. (And, if you notice, many of the answers are much more than just a simple, “Love it,” or “Hate it.”) You can bet that fans will be back to see and discuss other decorating features.

**Introduce Your Brand in a Meaningful Way**<br/>
As you acquire fans, you’ll want to circle back and introduce them to your brand. Of course, you also don’t want to bore the fans who have been with you from the beginning. The trick is to make the basics of your brand fresh and meaningful for everyone. [Avalon Laser Health’s](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Avalon-Laser-Health-live-without-pain/114165645283208) introduction to their services leads with a question to draw in their audience.  Making the information meaningful ensured that the post received likes and shares.

It takes time to build a rapport with your audience through social media—there is no formula for going viral overnight. A spike in engagement is good, but you really want to focus on continuous engagement. Don’t be frustrated by posts that only receive one or two likes, comments, or shares. Instead, look at your engagement and see how your strategy is panning out over a period of time. If you’re dedicated to making your Facebook page a success, you can do it.
