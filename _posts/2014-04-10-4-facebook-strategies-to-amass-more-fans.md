Feel like your brand’s Facebook page is in a rut? Have you lost followers or haven’t seen an increase in quite some time? Your page, just like any other social media platform you have, is an extension of your brand. If your Facebook page is stagnated, it might be a symptom of a larger issue with your brand’s marketing strategy. It’s time to inject new life into your page and to get your customers excited about your brand again! Here are 4 painless ways to do that:

**Cross-Market Your Social Media**<br>
How often do you invite your audience to see what you’re pinning on Pinterest or tweeting on Twitter? Do your Facebook fans even know that you have other social media platforms? Do they know you have a blog and a website? If you answered no, get started cross-promoting right now!

**Run a Contest**<br>
There is a lot of good that can come from a well-run, well-planned contest or sweepstakes on Facebook. You can generate excitement and engagement while also collecting vital information about what interests your fans. Not to mention, you can grow your audience! Make sure that you familiarize yourself with [Facebook’s rules](https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php) so that you don’t end up on the wrong side of their policies.

**Offer a Deal**<br>
42% of Facebook fans have liked a page to get a coupon, code, or [deal for a business](http://blog.bufferapp.com/7-facebook-stats-you-should-know-for-a-more-engaging-page). Of course, you don’t want to offer a deal or coupon all of the time, but consider using Facebook as a way to help grow excitement for an upcoming sale or holiday. If business is slow, try introducing a coupon or discount code on Facebook to bolster sales. You’ll want to promote the opportunity—that way your audience knows to head to Facebook and like your page to get that deal!

**Interact with Your Fans**<br>
It’s a constant refrain from us here at INFINITUS: you need to interact with your fans! If you’re not, you’re losing out on engagement and relationships with the people who help you pay the bills! If you’re not answering customer questions, thanking posters for great reviews, and inserting yourself into valuable discussion on your wall, you are not creating a climate that will make your fans want to stay around. Make your fans feel valuable—interact with them!
