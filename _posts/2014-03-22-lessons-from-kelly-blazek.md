The social media world was abuzz last week when a story about rude LinkedIn rejection email hit the airwaves. Kelly Blazek, the operator of the only online job bank in Cleveland, Ohio, sent a searing email to a job seeker who had tried to connect with her over [LinkedIn](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/tech/web/linked-in-cleveland-job-bank/). Blazek ripped into the job seeker for her lack of etiquette. But in the world of the Internet, the rules are never as black and white as we’d like—how do you know what is appropriate? These tips might not get you out of trouble with a shark like Blazek, but they will make you more professional (and less annoying) so that you can cultivate meaningful relationships on LinkedIn.

**Be Professional**<br/>
Be aware of your online presence—it’s an extension of your professional persona. Remember, LinkedIn is a network for creating and maintaining professional relationships—it’s not Facebook or Twitter. Be sure to treat it accordingly. Don’t send mass messages—InMails or otherwise— asking for recommendations or giving holiday greetings to your entire network. And of course, with any personal messages you send, make sure that you use appropriate language and proofread your work.  Along the same lines, make sure that your profile picture is a professional, clean photo—and certainly not one from a family gathering or party.

**Be Active**<br>
Building relationships on LinkedIn means that you need to be acutely cognizant of your presence.  Contribute content that is pertinent to your industry and expertise. Likewise, spend a little time each week commenting and liking others, but do so with caution and restraint. Be strategic, especially when adding others as a contact. If the relationship is new or tenuous, spend the extra time adding a custom note and being personable. Don’t mistake being active on LinkedIn for looking desperate or spammy.

**Be Yourself**<br>
Don’t mistake being professional for being bland and robotic. Don’t write your profile like you would a resume. Spend time crafting your LinkedIn profile so that it reflects you in an authentic way. Write in the first person and summarize your experience personably. Doing this will help to ensure that your profile tells your story rather than just hitting bullet points and statistics.

When in doubt, imagine how your audience will react to your messages. How would you feel receiving your message if you were the recipient? Would you take offense to your profile picture or recommendation? How does your profile appear to future employers and possible connections? If it gives you pause, think long and hard before you hit the send or publish button.
