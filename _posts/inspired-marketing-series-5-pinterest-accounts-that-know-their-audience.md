Welcome to our Inspired Marketing Series! Every week, we’ll point you in the direction of great, successful social media profiles and websites and break them down for you. This week, we searched high and low for five Pinterest accounts that really get it when it comes to their followers. Take notes, enjoy the visual journey, but most importantly, be inspired!  
 
**[The Great Canadian Adventure Company](http://www.pinterest.com/adventurescom/)**<br>
This travel company, based in Alberta, has a visually pleasing Pinterest set-up. Each board is clearly labeled (“Cycling Tours,” “Lake Canoeing”). There are no erroneous boards or pins. Each board is focused and features beautiful, click-worthy pins. After you visit their Pinterest, it’s hard not to want to schedule a tour!

**[REAL SIMPLE](http://www.pinterest.com/realsimple/)**<br>
REAL SIMPLE, a lifestyle and home decor magazine and homewares line, is a master at understanding their audience. With 128 boards and over 400,000 followers, their pins deliver every time. REAL SIMPLE also features simply titled boards with engaging pins. Their boards are grouped by topic which makes it easier to find things (and easier to stay clicking around their account). For example, their wedding boards are in the same area; boards that feature upcoming holidays are rotated to the top of their profile.

**[CNet](http://www.pinterest.com/cnet/)**<br>
As a leader in technology reviews, CNet needs to have an online presence-- and they deliver. While their display may not be as beautiful as other Pinterest accounts, that is secondary for CNet followers. After all, they’re there for the technology news and reviews. And that’s exactly what their followers get. Every board and pin is laser-focused on technology-- even their humor boards!

**[National Ballet of Canada](http://www.pinterest.com/nationalballet/)**<br>
Unlike any of the other Pinterest accounts featured in this post, the National Ballet uses their Pinterest account in a vastly different way. It is an interactive display case of their dancers and shows. Most of the pins do not link to another website; instead, they are photos that have been uploaded directly onto Pinterest by their account. While that may be frustrating for some users who want more information, it works for this kind of account.

**[Chronicle Books](http://www.pinterest.com/chroniclebooks/)**<br>
Chronicle Books, a publishing company located in San Francisco, gets that Pinterest is for growing community and sharing.  Their account isn’t just about their books or their products, it’s about the lifestyle that their book-loving customers lead-- one that is “inspired by the enduring magic of books.” The account features group boards that are curated by authors and artisans, which helps to create its community feel.
