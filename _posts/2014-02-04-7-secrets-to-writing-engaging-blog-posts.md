**Stick to one, specific topic.**<br/>
Blog posts are usually best received when they are digestible pieces of content. Your readers don’t expect you to solve the world in one post. Focus on one specific topic for each blog. If it’s getting long, consider breaking it up into a few pieces and publishing a series. Some blogs (like medium) have even added “estimated reading time” to the beginning of each blog post so people know what they’re getting into before they start reading.

2. ![alt Be useful or entertaining](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_mz5qmmNWV91smy9ueo1_250.gif "Be useful or entertaining")<br/>
**Be useful or entertaining**<br/>
I heard somewhere recently that people consume content for two reasons: because it’s useful or because it’s entertaining. Is your content one or the other? Even better, is it both? *(The elusive thing the cool kids in marketing call ‘EDUTAINMENT.’ Clever.)*

3. ![alt Break it up into sections or lists](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_n0byhodZ0m1s6bleqo2_250.gif "Break it up into sections or lists")<br/>
**Break it up into sections or lists**<br/>
Readers will often scan content instead of reading every single word. Make it easy for them by adding headlines, bulleted lists, numbered lists, pull quotes, and other formatting to break up your wall of text.

4. ![alt Write to one person](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_mzfvsho6Uj1tpg4boo1_400.gif "Write to one person")<br/>
**Write to one person**<br/>
Well, hey there, good looking. Thanks for making it this far. Now, I need you to do one thing for every blog post you write for the rest of your life: stop talking to the “world,” your “audience,” or “you’s guys.” Your words are being read by ONE person at a time. Write directly to that one perfect client.

5. ![alt Add your own personality, experiences and thoughts](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_mzqrs9rn1D1smy9ueo1_500.gif "Add your own personality, experiences and thoughts")<br/>
**Add your own personality, experiences and thoughts**<br/>
It’s true: everything has already been written. But, not by you. Put your own spin on your topic by adding unique metaphors, stories from your own life, and your (brand) personality. Your own life and business is a great source of stories - get in the habit of jotting down a few notes when something interesting happens. Sharing them in your writing will create a personal connection with your reader.

6. ![alt Write for your customers, not your peers](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_n088hh7SwW1t4o62mo1_500.gif "Write for your customers, not your peers")<br/>
**Write for your customers, not your peers**<br/>
Aside from trying to write to hundreds of readers all at once, the other big mistake I often see is that professionals write for their peers instead of for their customers. Take all of the industry jargon out, and speak the language of your customers. Make sure that you are writing about topics that your CLIENTS care about, not just you (chances are they don’t care about the tools you use to do your job - they care about the results).

7. ![alt Make it multi-media](//dddb43dxo5lmp.cloudfront.net/blog-images/tumblr_mzg6b6UHcL1smy9ueo1_500.gif "Make it multi-media")<br/>
**Make it multi-media**<br/>
Engaging content doesn’t have to be purely written words. Add life to your blog posts with audio, video, graphics, design, and images. Experiment with different forms to see what comes easiest to you, and to see what your readers/viewers respond to best.
