###The question is, do you have what it takes to get a piece of the pie?

**Getting started**: This can be easier than ever. Depending on what your needs are, you can get setup on a hosted platform like Shopify, Etsy, or Ebay in a matter of hours. If you need a more custom solution (like one that integrates with your existing inventory systems), an eCommerce store can be built for you by web design and development companies like us. Whichever option you choose, make sure that it looks extremely professional. If customers don’t trust you at first glance, they’re not going to open their wallets for you.

**Marketing Research/Validation**: Are people actively searching for your product? You can use a tool like Google’s Keyword Planner (which can be found inside of Google Adwords) to see the search traffic for your target keywords. If the number isn’t in the tens of thousands, you may want to rethink your product or service due to the low market size. You want there to be a big pie there to grab a piece of - not just scrapes you’ll have to fight for. Also, consider offering your product in a low-cost way like on Craigslist, ebay or etsy first to see if people are generally interested in purchasing it. Finally, make sure that there are competitors for your product online. If there isn’t, that’s not usually a good thing. That means that no one is making money in your specific niche.  This might be controversial advice, but it’s cheaper to win customers over who already know that they want your product than to educate them on why they need it. 

**Traffic**: Unfortunately, just because you buy a catchy URL and get a well designed website up doesn’t mean that you can quit your day job or book a one-way ticket to Bali just yet. You’ll need to craft a brand and marketing plan that is going to attract your target customers to your site. One of the most effective ways to do this is content marketing, coupled with an email list. Online advertising can also be a great way to start or supplement your traffic, but be sure to watch your customer acquisition cost closely. 

**Product photography and descriptions**: Since people can’t pick up and feel your product, you have to do a great job of showing them how it is going to benefit their lives in pictures and words. Professional photography and copywriting is generally a great investment. 

**Conversion tracking**: Conversion rates will become your best friends and worst enemies in eCommerce. You’ll want to be continuously tracking your conversions to leads and sales from each of your traffic sources, and also for each of your pages and products. eCommerce gives you the unique ability to “trim the fat” in almost real time to get rid of what isn’t working, and put more energy and money into what does work.
