Start the [theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyz_2DEah4o&feature=kp) and turn up the volume as you read this post. If you need to, drop down and give yourself twenty or take a minute and find some gold chains, Mr.-T-syle. (Just don’t blow up a car.) Why all of the adrenaline? Because you’re your business’ Hannibal. And every Hannibal needs a team. Get pumped—we’re giving you the tools to create your very own A-Team!

**Recognize Your Employees’ Humanity**<br>
People work best when they feel wanted and respected and when they believe in their task. As you’re choosing members for your team, recognize who they are as people first and workers second. Think about and strategize how each team member can best be used. How do their personalities bring different skill sets and opportunities to the table? What are their dream jobs?

**Give Opportunities for Growth**<br>
Once you know what your team members’ strengths, weaknesses, and dreams are, strategize. Invest time and energy into your team—it will boost morale and make your team more skilled individuals. Think about incorporating mentorship and training opportunities for your employees. Don’t be afraid to let your team members take the lead—assign work that plays to their strengths. In short, give your team members the tools and opportunity to work their dream job.

**Be Flexible**<br>
Because you’re building the best team, you need to treat them like the best. Listen to your team and adjust with their suggestions and ideas. Give them the latitude to make decisions and be creative—allow for ownership over projects. Be sure to set clear deadlines and deliverables. Flexibility might sound scary—giving up autonomy can be—but managed correctly, it can revolutionize your business and energize your team.

These are just the basics, but they are integral to creating a functioning, dynamic team. Stop thinking about being a manager or boss as project-driver; instead, think of yourself as a guide.  Know your team’s specialties, personalities, and goals. Give them the opportunity to show off and play to their strengths. Keep your team working towards the goal, but give them more opportunities to create the path to that goal.
