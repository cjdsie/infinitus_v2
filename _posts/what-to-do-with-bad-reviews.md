It’s probably a nightmare of yours: you log in and see a negative comment on your brand’s Facebook, there’s a nasty review on Yelp, or someone writes an angry post on Google. There’s one star or—oh no!— zero stars. Your brand’s reputation—which you’ve worked so hard on—is at stake and you feel like you need to defend it.  Stop. Take a breath. Back away from the keyboard until you have a strategy.

**Don’t Get Defensive**<br/>
Negative commenters have an axe to grind.  They feel horribly wronged—correctly or incorrectly—and they want to make sure that everyone else knows it, too. Do not—and I repeat, do not—take the bait. You will want to, but don’t do it.  A nasty response, name-calling, or defensive anger will backfire and multiply every time. Just think about Amy’s Baking Company. This restaurant, based out of Scottsdale, Arizona, landed on Ramsey’s Kitchen Nightmares for this exact problem: they had alienated their customers by their belligerently angry online responses to reviews. Because of their online presence, they were on the cusp of bankruptcy. People now like their Facebook page just to see their hateful rants against their customers. While that’s an extreme example, it’s a salient point: don’t travel down that path at all.

**Apologize and Make Amends**<br/>
Instead of getting defensive or even, kill ‘em with kindness. Respond to the negative comment with a sincere apology and an attempt at some kind of restitution or recompense. If the negative commenter brought up an important point that you know is a weakness, explain how you’re planning on fixing that issue with your brand. Thank them for bringing it to your attention. While it may not change the commenter’s opinion of your business, it will definitely make a strong, positive statement to anyone who reads the reviews.

**Craft Your Brand’s Narrative**<br/>
The way you respond—both online and offline—is how you continually craft and refine your brand’s narrative.  Everything you do builds on it. Think about the tone and structure of your response. How do you want your customers to see you? How do you want potential customers to see you?  

**Look for Positive Reviews**<br/>
While you don’t want to—and shouldn’t—incentivize positive reviews from your customers, it is okay to ask them to honestly review their experience with you. It may feel like you’re padding your reviews, but you’re not. People who have negative interactions are more likely to take to the internet to air their grievances; people who have positive ones usually don’t think about spraying it all over the web. Reminding customers that they can review your services online is really painting the whole story of your business.
 
Each person who interacts with you and your brand will have a slightly different experience with you. Try as you might, you will always have customers who are not happy with your service or who feel wronged. Understand your reviews as a pulse on your brand. Are you seeing a lot of negative reviews about a particular aspect of your company? If so, it might be time to brainstorm and try to fix it. Most of all, don’t lose sleep over positive or negative reviews. Take them for what they are: the personal opinions of individuals.
