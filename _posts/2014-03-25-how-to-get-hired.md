As you might know, we recently hired a Project and Client Manager. We just posted the job ad on Weworkremotely.com about a month ago and got a ton of promising replies. We’ve had a few doozies too, so I wanted to offer some advice from this side of the process. If you want the job, here’s what you need to do:

**Network, Network, Network**<br/>
First of all, build your networks. Make friends in the industry you want to work in. Make sure that you maintain a professional presence online and that you share what you are up to. LinkedIn works well, but so does an active presence on Twitter, Facebook, a blog… you get the idea. When I have someone in my network whose work I’m already familiar with, that carries more weight than a random resume. 

**Pay Attention to the Email**<br>
You might feel like jotting off a quick, “Attached please find…” email when sending us your application package. Don’t! In the digital age, your email is probably THE most important piece to getting an interview.

The opening lines of your email and your resume objective need to be two things:

1. Tell us what value you’ll bring to this opportunity. How will we benefit from working with you?
2. Flatter us. Look at the work we’ve done. Demonstrate that you’ve looked us up and that you know exactly what our objectives and purposes are.

**Don’t Be Afraid to Be Human**<br>
Let’s be honest-- looking through a stack of resumes and applications can be very repetitive. Surprise me. Give me a reason to remember your resume-- in a good way, of course! 

Humour helps. For this particular job description, organization is a must. My favourite replies have made specific references to the candidate’s organization:

* “...it sounds like a really great fit for me (and not only because my closet IS organized by color).”
* “I'm so OCD about organization that my underwear drawer is color-coded with QR codes.”

If humour isn’t your strong suit, that’s okay. After all, we’re not looking for comedians: we’re looking for dynamic individuals. Show us your passion and excitement for this work! Sound like a real human writing a real email-- not robot spitting out copy full of business jargon. 

**Cross Your T’s and Dot Your I’s**
Don’t gloss over the requirements for application-- spend some time reading and rereading what we want from you. Pay attention to ALL pieces of the job description. If we include a specific challenge that we’re trying to work through, go the extra step and show ways you’ve overcome similar (or identical) obstacles or offer specific suggestions on what you would do to help.

Be just as intentional about your resume. Resumes are, in general, absolutely awful. They are bland and, after reading a few, they all look the same. If you can make yours less awful to read (and more exciting view), that is a HUGE plus. A little design work goes a long way! And by the way, lose all of the business-speak mumbo jumbo-- just write how you talk. 

**Sell Yourself**
Since you’re applying to a digital marketing agency, I expect you to have some ability to market yourself online. Include links to LinkedIn, Twitter, and any other sites you are on. (Speaking of social media: be mindful your presence. Many people don’t realize that the Facebook pages you “like” are often a public part of your profile. I can tell a lot about someone from those likes.) Don’t make me google you-- although I still will. 

Of course, a huge part of showing us that you’re right for the job is demonstrating that you can do the work. Highlight your biggest accomplishments and the biggest names you have worked with or for. It builds credibility. If you are mentioning a brand that isn’t a household name, make sure to translate into metrics and terms that everyone will understand.

It comes down to authenticity: we want to work with real people who are passionate and driven. We want to be wowed and inspired by the work you do because we want to have the best people possible on board INFINITUS. Give us every opportunity to see yourself!
