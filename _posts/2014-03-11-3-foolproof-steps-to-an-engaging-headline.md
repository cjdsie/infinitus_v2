We’ve got a five-minute challenge for you! 

Look at the content that you’ve posted on your brand’s blog in the past few months. Take special note of the headlines. What do you notice about the titles? Are you using them to the fullest? 

Are you making sure that they’re working on three levels: for SEO, for your audience, and for your brand? If they’re not, you’re losing out on valuable site traffic! Never fear-- we’ve got three steps that will help you squeeze every last productive drop from your headlines!

**Include Keywords**<br/>
Using keywords ensures that people searching will be able to find your work. Don’t title a post about ice cream, “A Frozen Dream.” People searching those keywords won’t be looking for post about ice cream, so they won’t stick around if Google directs them there. (And honestly, what does “A Frozen Dream” really mean? It’s just a lot of fluff!) Instead, the title, “Ice Cream: Vanilla or Chocolate?” will keep readers interested in your content because that’s what they were searching for. 

Not sure what keywords to use? Check out [this resource for a quick tutorial](https://todaymade.com/blog/google-adwords-seo/).

**Give it Value**<br/>
Give your audience a reason for reading! Headlines that have some kind of value—a great recipe, advice, steps to solving a problem—are intrinsically more attractive than those that offer nothing to their readers. A headline that reads, “3 Foolproof Steps to an Engaging Headline,” is way more clickable than “How to Write a Headline.”  And it ensures that your audience doesn’t leave disappointed because they know exactly why they clicked and read your content!

**Be Precise**<br/>
You know your niche. You know your audience. Make sure that your headline is just as precise. After all, your audience wants to read your work, but with so much information on the internet, they’re not going to spend time on something that doesn’t meet their needs. 

Have the perfect cookie recipe? When you write a title like, “Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe,” you’re hitting important keywords and adding value, but you’re not telling the whole story. After all, your recipe is delicious! “Recipe for the Chewiest Chocolate Chip Cookies” hits the nail on the head. The attention to detail will attract readers and keep them interested in what you have to offer.
 
As you practice crafting excellent titles for your content, you’ll find that it will quickly become second nature. And, as it becomes second nature, you’ll notice an [increase in traffic, backlinks](http://goinfinitus.com/myposts/3-easy-ways-to-get-recognized), and sharing—it will stand out among all of the other content online.  And that’s what you want: to move away from the pack and be the go-to resource in your area of expertise!
