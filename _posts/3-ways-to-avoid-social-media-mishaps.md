Have you ever seen a business go viral (in a very bad way) on social media? 

Social media is such a fast-paced world that mistakes can happen and be amplified in very little time. While a small mishap on a personal page might not make a splash, an ill-timed joke, poorly phrased sentiment, or confusing tone can take a toll on a business. Learn from these business giants so that you won’t make the same missteps they have!

**Know What’s Going On**<br/>
If you notice a certain person or hashtag trending, do research before you jump on the bandwagon and post about it. Entenmann’s, a bakery, tweeted, “Who’s #notguilty about eating all the tasty treats they want?!” after seeing that #notguilty was trending. Cute, right? The problem? #notguilty was referring to the verdict of the Casey Anthony trial. This problem is an easy one to fix, though. Just use [Tagdef](http://tagdef.com/) to look up the definitions of popular hashtags so that you’re informed before you post!

**Check Your Tone**<br/>
The point of social media is to be more hands-on and interactive with your audience, not to estrange them from you. Take a lesson from Bank of America who, in responding to a financial activist’s tweet, disseminated seemingly canned messages to everyone who interacted with the tweet. Even though Bank of America said that their tweets were sent out by humans, the tone seemed to say otherwise: “We’d be happy to review your account with you to discuss any concerns. Please let us know if you need assistance.” Make sure your audience knows that there’s a person behind the tweets—that they’re actually connecting with a person.

**Don’t Capitalize on a Tragedy**<br/>
You’re probably thinking, “Of course, I wouldn’t do that! Who would?” It’s morally reprehensible, and quite frankly, just bad business. Surprisingly, a lot of brands already have – to immense public outcry and displeasure. Kenneth Cole seems to be the master of capitalizing on tragedy. Referencing the US’s decision on whether or not to send troops to Syria, the company posted, “’Boots on the ground’ or not, let’s not forget about sandals, pumps and loafers. #Footwear.”  A day after the Boston Marathon Bombing, Epicurious tweeted, “In honor of Boston and New England, maybe we suggest: whole-grain cranberry scones!” and “Boston, our hearts are with you. Here’s a bowl of breakfast energy we could all use to start the day…”
 
By now, you’re probably shaking your head. These mistakes by large companies seem simple to see why they went wrong, but history—even the seemingly short history of social media—shows that we will continue making these same mistakes. When in doubt, don’t post it. It’s far better to hold back on a joke or a statement that you think might cause a problem than to publish it and have to repair your tarnished reputation.
