**In this episode you’ll learn (amongst other things…):**
  
- To stop talking about yourself and instead focus on who your customer is, what their problem is and how you intend to solve that problem.
- Be explicit in what solution you are recommending.
- Your proposal is essentially a sales document: write copy that sells.
- Use the same language, including keywords, that your customers use.
- Do research into who you customers are: spend time talking to them.
- You need to research who the exact customer is that you’re proposing to. Who is the decision maker? What are the company politics? What are the objectives motivating the decision maker?
- Using Bidsketch can save you hours of work on each proposal; from as much as 10 to 2.
- Attention to detail is important and using Bidsketch can help you avoid ‘copy & paste’ errors.
- Customers who use Bidsketch landing pages for their clients’ proposals win 18% more business.
- Using the Bidsketch e-signature feature, gets proposals returned 60% faster.
- Adding ‘Optional Fees’ within a proposal earns 32% more revenue.
- Proposals that go into lengthy detail over each costing have 35% approval compared to 47% when done in a more streamlined grouped together way.
