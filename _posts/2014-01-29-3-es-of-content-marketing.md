Whenever we set out to create a content marketing strategy for one of our clients, it helps us to have a framework to build out the custom content from. Here’s our secret sauce - feel free to borrow and steal this to create your own effective content.

First, it might help to define content marketing. [Wikipedia’s definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing) is pretty good:

<blockquote>
	Content marketing is any marketing format that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire customers. This information can be presented in a variety of formats, including news, video, white papers, e-books, infographics, case studies, how-to guides, question and answer articles, photos, etc.
	Content marketing is focused not on selling, but on simply communicating with customers and prospects. The idea is to inspire business and loyalty from buyers by delivering "consistent, ongoing valuable information".
	</blockquote>
	
Another way to understand content marketing is to think of your favorite TV show. (I love Battlestar Galactica and lately, the Walking Dead. How about you?) Anyway…. traditional marketing is like the commercials that interrupt shows. Actually quite literally, that is traditional advertising. However, modern content marketing means that businesses are starting to produce the content that people actually want - the show. 

To plan your content marketing, start thinking of your business like your own TV channel. Your channel can have different shows on it, but it’s going to have a unifying theme. For example, HGTV airs shows about home and gardens: buying, selling, renovating, decorating, real estate agents, staging, etc. 

Instead of having to buy or rent space from someone else, your business becomes the media. You get to create the messages that people consume. If you do it correctly, this effort will result in leads and sales. 

I want to reiterate that content does not necessarily mean written blogs. Many people shy away from content marketing because they don’t have the time or desire to write, but content can take many forms: video, audio, images, slideshows, infographics, magazines, curated content, and more. Your imagination is your only limitation.

###The 3 “E’s” of Content Marketing

**Entertain**

Humor can be hard to pull off, but making your audience laugh is really powerful. On youtube, entertaining videos are the ones that are shared most often. This includes music videos, humor, and surprising ones (have you seen the double rainbow video?). To create an entertaining video, you’ll probably need to enlist someone who has a talent for humor or other talent. Forcing entertainment can backfire on you. 

Other ways to entertain your audience that don’t include finding professional a comic or singer to help promote your business could be talking about your industry’s smelly armpits (whatever that may be…), using beautiful imagery, well designed graphics, or using colorful language to accomplish the second “E.”

**Educate**

Teaching and sharing knowledge with your audience is the easiest way to start creating content. As a professional, you know a lot more than the average person about your job and related topics. I’m sure your family and friends ask you for advice often - those are great places to start to create content that helps others. 

Another great source of educational content inspiration is conversations with your customers. If you aren’t talking with your clients or customers every day, make sure that you talk to your employees that are. Find out what their concerns, questions, and everyday thoughts are. If you see a common theme or topic, these are great ideas to cover in your content creation. 

**Engage**

“Engage” means different things on different platforms. On social media, this often means asking questions, interacting directly with your audience, being “human-like,” and commenting on current events. On your blog, it means that you should produce content that is conversational. You could also start a question and answer series that you post on your blog where your audience submits questions for you to answer. 

One last powerful tip to “engage” with your content marketing is to interact with your industry peers through your content. For example, if you are a real estate agent, you could feature your favorite mortgage, staging, cleaning, insurance, and other professionals (along with snippets of their valuable advice) on your site. It’s a win-win situation - it gives you content to post that is valuable to your audience, and builds your relationship with industry peers who could potentially refer work to you later.
