Website security isn’t particularly sexy. It takes time and can be expensive to stay ahead of the Internet’s hackers and shady characters. But, much like paying your car insurance bill every month, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of regret. 

There’s also the feeling, “it’s never going to happen to me.” We feel secure in our everyday lives. It’s not a natural or pleasant feeling to be ultra-cautious. However, that type of ignorance can be anything but blissful.

**So, why worry about website security? What’s at stake?**

1. Lost sales. If you have an eCommerce website, downtime means lost sales.

2. Compromised customer information. If you collect any customer information or registrations on your website and don’t follow the latest security best practices, you could be putting your customer’s data at risk. Breaches in security can be a publicity nightmare.

3. Damaged brand image. If customers trying to visit your site get a warning that your site contains malware, it reflects negatively on your brand. Same goes if they visit your site and find it populated with (ahem...) male enhancement ads.

4. Lost time. Recovering a hacked site, notifying customers, managing the press, etc. all takes time away from the work you should be doing. Time away from your revenue generating activities hurts your bottom line. 

5. Big expense. If you are the unfortunate victim of a privacy or technology breach, you’re likely going to need to hire experts to fix the situation and upgrade your security. A time-sensitive, emergency service is going to cost more than being prepared. 

**What can you do?**

Since you are likely not an expert in web security, thankfully there are professionals (like us) who worry about this for you. 

We have invested in several international security experts who perform rigorous security tests. They are “good hackers” and try to break into the system. Their work finds soft spots in the code, so we can fix them before they ever become an issue. 

Website security isn’t a one-time “set and forget” situation. It takes regular updates and monitoring. After we set our clients up with the best platform available, we offer maintenance and monitoring to keep it in tip-tip shape. 

**Ways to keep your website safe**:

1. Backups. I think everyone “knows” they should back up digital data (from all of those digital images from family trips on your computer, to yes, your website), but not many people actually do anything about it. We take the remembering out of it and take care of it for you.

2. Monitoring. If something does happen to your site, you should be the first to know about it - not the morning news channel. We keep a close eye on things so we can take quick and efficient action if something does happen.

3. Security updates and patches. The Internet security world is changing all the time (those darn hackers are kind of like a flu virus that keeps evolving). We keep up with the latest threats and take steps to prevent them. 

By investing in security, we are proud to offer an in-house (we’re the only ones that have our system) platform and maintenance plan that keeps our clients’ websites safe and secure. And sleeping soundly at night.
