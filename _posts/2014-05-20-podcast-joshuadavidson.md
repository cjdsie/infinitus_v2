**In this episode you’ll learn (amongst other things…):**
  
- How Joshua has worked with both national and local companies and streamlined their processes using web based technology
- Don’t fix what’s not broken… but automate what’s not broken and make it even better
- Before you begin, you need to understand your organization’s strengths and weaknesses
- If you create an automated solution for your company, there’s a good chance you could sell it to other companies in your field!
- You need patience and an open mind during the process of automating your systems: it takes time to get it right
- Testing alone can take at least four to six months and then you need a period of training
- Think about it: “what is eight months now versus an additional half a million dollars a year, a year from now?”
- How Joshua has set up ‘Entrepreneur Getaway’ for those entrepreneurs who feel guilty about taking vacations - you can join him and others at Disneyworld November 2014
