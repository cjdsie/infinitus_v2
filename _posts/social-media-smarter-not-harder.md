Think Social Media isn’t for you?
Not sure what to say? 
Guess what?

###Good Social Media Comes from Good Ideas

Good social media has at its core, good content. 
And good content comes from good ideas that engage your customer. 
So instead of just tweeting or posting what you ate for lunch, or waiting for something to happen, smart companies know that effective social media isn’t just empty chatter.  

Here are 5 clever examples of how businesses have used social media to connect, help their customers, and grow their businesses

**Example 1. Create Some Fun**
A ski resort wanted to use social media to talk about their winter preparations but realized that a lot of the work they did was not interesting to most people. So they got their mascot out and took pictures of him with a tools fixing the lifts, painting a wall, then baking cookies, and answering the phone. The mascot-as-mechanic image was so popular other resorts copied it the next year.

**Example 2. Make a Social Media Event**
Through Facebook and Twitter a photographer offered to give a free digital portrait to anyone who showed up at her studio during a slow week. The only rule: they needed to share the photo on social media.  Each day more people showed as the photos were shared, and the photographers’ social media accounts also grew, along with her name and reputation for taking great photos – and for being innovative. 

**Example 3. Move Service to the Internet**
A new pharmacy wanted to attract customers to its prescription service so they started a Q&A website about medications and then put the web address along with Facebook and Twitter accounts on signs in their store. Now people with questions know they can go online to ask instead of phoning in. The pharmacists answer the questions when its slow and the unique and helpful service got them talked about in the community.

**Example 4. Share Your Expertise**
A Lawyer often used his Twitter account to comment on news stories from a legal perspective. As a result of his insightful comments, the account became popular among people interested in local and regional issues. Among those interested were journalists who began to rely on the lawyer for his informed insights. The journalists contacted the lawyer for comment on stories and as a result of the media profile the lawyer’s practice grew. 
 
**Example 5. Get Social Offline** 
A city printer held a "business network" event (i.e. party) to get closer to their clients, suppliers, and brand partners. They invited vendors and partners, and major clients, and did a short demonstration that was mostly fun but also had some helpful points about how they work. Building social ties offline helps build ties online. And then of course the pictures are great for blackmail later! Or just for social sharing. (Delete the scandalous ones…maybe.) Spending time offline builds ties that will extend online. 

**The Real Value of Social Media is Reach**
What social media really offers are opportunities and tools to let you create better communication in ways that your customers actually care about.  It’s not all about finesse or about “being social”.  It’s about doing things that people want to hear about, or providing new options for communication that people will value. 

So don’t worry about what to say, as if it’s a first date. (You already know your customers or you wouldn’t be in business.) Instead think about would help your customers. Or what would engage them. Have your team read these examples, and then come up with your own. 

Let us know what you come up with. We’d love to hear it.  (Or call us and we’ll do it together!)
