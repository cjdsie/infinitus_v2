**In this episode you’ll learn (amongst other things…):**
  
- How some things in marketing really haven’t changed in the past 20 years. ‘Boring still doesn’t sell’
- There’s been a massive power shift in ‘voice’ from the corporation to the consumer
- The decline in ‘lead time’: in 1991 a campaign might take 12 hours to build, now it’s 12 days, or 12 hours
- Today’s real time metrics and ‘thinking’ mean you can shape campaigns on the fly and know what works
- To succeed you should have people in the early-mid twenties as part of your team and also listen to those young people in your family/friends network for feedback and ideas
- You need to create a culture in your marketing agency where it’s okay to fail and to take chances and then innovative ideas will happen - ‘being safe is really really risky’
- ‘Good news travels pretty fast and bad news travels really really fast’
- From an HR point of view you need to manage your own online reputation and profile
