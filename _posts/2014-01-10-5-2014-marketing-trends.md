1. If your site doesn’t look great on screens of all sizes, you’ll lose customers in 2014. Two years ago, you used to be able to get away with having a website that wasn’t optimized for mobile screens.<!--more--> Now, you’ll lose a minimum of 1 in 6 customers who are trying to view your site, and in some industries - 1 in 2. After all of the work you do to make people aware of you and drive them to your site, make sure that you’re not ignoring half of them once they arrive.

2. You not only need an email list, you need to start using it. If you’re smart, you’ve been collecting email addresses from your clients and prospects. If you’re really smart, you’ll use that list to make sure those people who are already interested in your business are reminded to do business with you over and over again. Sending out a regular eNewsletter that provides value to your readers is going to be paramount in 2014. 

3. Marketing is going to get harder. There is still a teeny bit of room for first movers to make big strides online, but most smart companies are already handling the basics pretty well. If you want to stand out in 2014, you’ll have to go pro: step up your website, step up your relationship building and lead nurturing on social, and create compelling content regularly. 

4. Even if you’re small or “the only guy in town,” you can’t expect consumers to jump through hoops to do business with you. Your appointment setting, contact and registration forms, and prices and policies should all be online. If you are still asking consumers to fax or mail things to you, you are going to be left behind.

5. Companies that listen to their clients in 2014 will win. Those who are responsive to their audience’s needs and tailor their products/services/promotion to the current desires of their market will be rewarded with lots of new business.
