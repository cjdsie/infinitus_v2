Once upon a time, not long ago... “keyword optimizing” a page was the ticket to great SEO and showing up on search engines. Search engine optimization (SEO) used to mean ignoring your end user to make sure that the bots inside of the search engines were seeing what they wanted to see.<!--more--> 

**Need a 5% keyword saturation? Let’s do it!** 
**Keyword needs to be in every title tag on the page? OK!**
**SEO is a game that we can win! <insert evil laugh>**

Yuck. The result that comes from this kind of mindset is an awkward and boring read that is light on actual meaning. This post is our plea for you to stop thinking about search engine marketing this way.

Thankfully, search engines have gotten smarter. Instead of a simple algorithm, the search algorithm now measures hundreds of factors to determine what content is the best and most relevant to the terms being searched. It’s almost impossible to keep up with what is actually working from day to day. 

Instead of stressing out about keeping up with the latest SEO tactics, there’s another way. And bonus - when you stop worrying about SEO, your search engine rankings should actually get better! Instead of worrying about keywords and titles, worry about if your content is GOOD or not. Ask yourself;

1. Will people want to share this content with their peers?
2. Does it help them solve a problem?
3. Is it entertaining to read?
4. Is it easy to share on social media? 
5. Does it invoke an emotion or feeling? 
6. Is it worthy of the time you’re asking people to spend reading/watching it?
7. Is it visually pleasing? 
8. Is it helpful?
9. Is it something that people would bookmark and come back to?
10. Does it prompt conversation? 
11. Am I producing content regularly?

These questions are all *infinitely* more important than if your title or content has the right keyword density. Tweet this: [Good, shareable content is infinitely more important than keyword density](http://ctt.ec/o0g1a). 

As Google and other search engines have evolved, they’ve recognized that these are questions are more important than even keywords are. As a result, they’ve increased the weight that inbound links and social sharing carry. And afterall, your target customers are not Google robots - they are living, breathing human beings. Create content for them.
