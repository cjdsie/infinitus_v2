As the leaves are turning color and fall air (and football!) is here, it seems like it was just yesterday we were enjoying the summer heat.  It’s hard to imagine that the holiday season is right around the corner.

So, are you prepared?

October is your B2B or service business’ most important month to prepare for. September has passed, with its busy transition from summer to school year. Next month, your clients and customers will be starting to get busy with holiday parties, planning, and vacations. This month, October, is the prime time to fill your sales pipeline while you can more easily capture the precious attention of your prospects. 

Here are some ways that you can fill your docket with work and leads, so you can coast through the holiday season into 2014:

1. Create an online lead-generating event. Events like hosting a live webinar, offering a limited time report download, or holding a contest can bring an influx of new leads into your business. 

2. Plan an in-person event. Here at INFINITUS, we’re planning a series of in-person workshops for current and potential clients (and everyone else who is interested in learning more about digital marketing and technology). Events are a great way to introduce yourself to new audiences, position yourself as an expert, and attract press coverage.

3. Reach out to your current & past clients. People who know, like, and trust you already will be easier to sell to than brand new prospects. Figure out ways that you can deepen your relationship and help your clients or customers more. 

4. Create a new subscription service. If you can offer clients regular value on a monthly or quarterly basis, you can stabilize your cash flow with those recurring sales.  

5. Ruthlessly pursue press, interviews and new relationships. Consider making October your month to be interviewed 30 times (or interview 30 people for your blog - blogging regularly increases website traffic by 5 times, according to Hubspot). Or, try taking 30 different people out to coffee or lunch. Write 30 (or 20, or 15) expert articles to submit to relevant blogs, media, or organizations. When people start to see you everywhere, they trust you. Building trust around your product or service will shorten the sales process. 

6. Ask for referrals. Make sure that your close friends, family and business contacts know that you are looking for work. Make it easy for them to identify good referrals by sharing who your target customer is, and what exactly you help them with. Make sure that you aren’t trying to appeal to everyone - pick a specific type of ideal customer. That way, you’ll train people to refer you high-quality prospects that you have a great chance of converting into a customer. 

Clients and customers are generally more receptive to making business decisions in October, since there aren’t other major distractions happening in their personal lives. Take advantage, and hustle! Your hard work will be the key to meeting 4th quarter goals and revenues.
