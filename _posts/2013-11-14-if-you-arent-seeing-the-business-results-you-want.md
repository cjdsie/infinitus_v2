Personally, we’ve had our shares of ups and downs in the business world. Some ventures have been awesome victories, and others have either fizzled out or crashed and burnt (never fun). After our own experiences and then working with hundreds of clients and talking to thousands of business owners, we’ve seen and heard a lot of success stories (our favorite) and some not-so-successful stories.

Along the way, we’ve learned something about what makes the great, great - and how to avoid the not-so-happy endings. It comes down to learning and mindset. And no, we’re not talking about mindset in the woo-woo “visualize your success and it will come” way - we’re talking about the framework that you see the world through. 

When you are learning a new discipline, say, online marketing, there are three levels of learning.

Most people stop on the 2nd level, and never see the success that they were hoping for. Since you’re not most people, I know that you are looking for real, lasting success. 

**The three levels of learning**:

1. Definitions: you learn the lingo, the tools, and the basic operation of each

2. Tactics: you learn ways that you can use the tools
  
3. Strategy: you apply an underlying, long-term strategy to make educated decisions and apply tactics to

Unfortunately, there isn’t a shortcut to get to the strategy part. You need to define things in a consistent way before you can use them. You need to know different options for using the tools you’ve acquired. Once you understand both, then you can craft a strategy. 

For example, if we’re talking about Facebook marketing:

1. Definitions: you need to know what a business page is, a post, how to schedule a post, and perhaps a little about Facebook’s algorithm, Edgerank, and how it affects what people see. 

2. Tactics: Next, you might learn that images are most often shared and engaged with on Facebook. There are certain times of the day that people engage more with your page. Asking direct questions encourages people to comment on your post. 
 
3. Strategy: Now, you get to the good stuff. The strategy is where you decide what you need to accomplish with your Facebook page, and the road map to get there. Likes and comments aren’t valuable in of themselves, so you need to define real business goals. Your goal may be to drive eCommerce sales, so you feature and educate people about your products. Often it isn’t as simple - for example, if you have a bigger product that requires a longer buying process, your goal will be to encourage email sign ups. Now you can take your goal, and apply tactics that will help you get there.

Also, this gives you a measuring stick to compare actual results to your desired results.

This is the stuff that great businesses are made of. Instead of throwing tactic after “best practice” after “what everyone else is doing” at the wall, you can have the peace of mind that your activities and time spent have REAL value and are perfect for YOUR business. After consistently applying the right tactics to your strategy that you took the time to think through, you’ll see success.
