The next time you’re watching TV, pay particular attention to the advertisements. Notice anything there that wasn’t there oh, two or three years ago?

If you guessed “hashtags,” you’d be absolutely right! With the popularity of smartphones, every business is suddenly infusing hashtags into their marketing campaigns so that consumers can find and interact with them easily through social media.

Hashtags are an interactive filing system that makes it easy for anyone interested in your topic to find your posts within each social media platform. Twitter first pioneered the hashtag, but it has since spread to every influential social media channel—Facebook, Pinterest, G+, Instagram—because it is appealing and useful to users.
 
While they may initially look like clutter in a message, hashtags amplify your reach to a broader audience than just your followers. And if other people outside of your circle of influence can find your work, they can retweet it, share it, follow you, feature it in on their site, contact you… Suffice it to say, they can interact with you more easily! And interaction leads to connections and opportunities!
 
Not sure how to get started? We’ve got a few tips for you! 

**Familiarize Yourself with What’s Out There**<br/>
You’ll want to use a variety of hashtags—both those that you create for your brand and those that you use so that people can find you in a larger discussion. Take some time looking at what hashtags are used in your industry and which ones apply to you. Familiarize yourself with the abbreviations and special tags that are used. For example, in the military community, #milso denotes the significant other of someone who is in uniform. It’s not something that is well-known outside of that specific community. If that is your target audience, hashtagging #milso in your post will generate interest and readers in that community.

**Be Discerning**<br/>
You’ve probably seen them: obnoxious tweets or posts that use nothing but hashtags. No one wants to read a message that is created entirely out of hashtags. Instead, choose the keywords that you think are important to that post. After all, you don’t want to sound like Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake.

**Create Your Own**<br/>
If you’re currently creating a marketing campaign, think about incorporating a hashtag into it. This invites your customers and clients to interact with your brand—giving visibility to you as well as a finger on the pulse of the campaign. Successful marketing campaigns with hashtags include Jeep (#StayRestless and #JeepLife), Coca-Cola (#AmericaIsBeautiful), and Applebee’s (#Appletizers). What could your custom hashtag be? 
 
Are you already using hashtags in your posts? If so, what have you noticed about your interaction and engagement with your followers? What advice would you give to someone wading into the deeper waters of social media?
