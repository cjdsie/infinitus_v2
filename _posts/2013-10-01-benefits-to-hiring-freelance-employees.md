Did you watch the TV show, ‘MacGyver’, back in the late 80’s? MacGyver was the ever-resourceful (fictional) government agent who solved complex problems with everyday materials he found at hand including his ever-present duct tape and Swiss Army knife.

One of the unique things about INFINITUS Marketing + Technology is the team that we’ve built. Our resourcefulness isn’t about finding average people and making them great - it’s about seeing beyond the normal limitations of physical location to find the best person for each job.
 
The digital world has broken down location barriers and has made it possible to find amazing employees in almost every part of the world. [Our team](/team) hails from Canada, the U.S., Europe, South America, and many places in between.

By piecing together the best people for each job, you can have several competitive advantages:

1. New perspectives: people with different life experiences naturally have different ways of tackling problems. Fresh eyes bring creative solutions to each project.
 
2. Time zone crushing: Our team works around the clock in different parts of the world. Instead of halting work at 5PM NST, work continues into the night, through Canadian holidays, and even occasionally on the weekends.
 
3. By trade, a digital marketing agency works in many different industries on many different projects. We’d be doing a disservice to our clients if we didn’t pull in the best experts in each area. When we bring each expert on, we get to tap into their vast amount of experience in their particular area.
 
4. By hiring freelancers/independent contractors when you need them, you keep your business lean and profitable. Hourly wages are typically higher, but you save by not needing to increase costs for benefits, overtime, , etc. You also save by not keeping a full load of employees if work slows.
 
5. Accountability: Freelance employees depend on their reputation to continue to get hired. Complacency and “getting too comfortable” doesn’t often happen on short-term projects, so you get top-notch work for every project.

There are major ‘pros’ to hiring a freelance workforce, so we have built a hybrid team of full-time on-location employees here in St. John’s and a fluid team of freelance employees across the globe.
