Are you obsessed with Downton Abbey like we are? 

From the first opening note of the credits to the (inevitably) gasp-worthy ending of each episode, we are entranced! There are so many lessons about love, life, and everything in between sandwiched between the stunning sets, costumes, and witty repartee! 

But we noticed that there’s so much that goes unsaid about leadership—so much that we can learn from both the upstairs and downstairs at Downton that we just had to share it with you.

**Change with the Times**<br/>
With every technological, social, or political advance, you can bet that one of the characters will comment on how much the world is changing or has changed. Even when characters are not fond of the change—who needs a refrigerator or electric toaster anyway?—they learn to deal with and take advantage of those changes. Often, they’re not happy about it, but they do so because they know it’s imperative to understand and acknowledge the future. Are you scoffing at this era’s new-fangled telephone and staying stuck in your rut? How are you changing with the times? What are you doing to ensure that you’re not left behind?

**Grace Never Goes Out of Style**<br/>
The inhabitants of Downton know how to be extremely gracious. While barbs are sometimes traded, they take great pains to ensure that they are hospitable and treat each other and their guests with decorum. This may seem like it’s from a bygone era at times, but have no fear—it’s not. Treating those you work with and your customers with respect and dignity can go a long way! How are you ensuring that your business is one of civility?

**Give Others Another Chance**<br/>
You might be as frustrated as we are at Mr. Carson and the rest for giving Thomas a second (and fifth and sixth) chance when he has shown himself to be so self-serving and slimy! However, Mr. Carson proves himself to a forgiving manager over and over again. He genuinely cares about the people he works with—from annoying Thomas to poor Mr. Molesely. Rather than looking like a pushover, he holds immense respect from his staff. Do you give your employees the chance to prove themselves after a mistake? How do you manage your image as a leader while still giving second chances?
 
Of course, there’s so much more to take away from Downton Abbey than just these three observations on leadership. 

If you’re a fan of the series, what leadership lessons do you see? Which character do you think demonstrates the most leadership?
