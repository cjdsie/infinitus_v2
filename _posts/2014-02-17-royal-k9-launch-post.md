If you like your heart to feel more like an ice block than warm and fuzzy, DO NOT go visit our newest website launch: Royal K9. There are pictures of puppies, adorable dogs, and beautiful pets. So again, if you prefer to be grumpy, definitely DO NOT visit the site. I can practically guarantee that you’ll experience an immediate “awww” and heart warming feeling.

Royal K9 is an interesting marketing case study and example for others to follow. Their business is extremely local. Pet boarding (and even pet training classes) are largely driven by convenience and proximity. However, by upgrading their web presence, they are accomplishing some very important goals.

1. Their current clients will be better served. Their full price menu, services offered and contact information are easy to find on the site. If a new client needs to reference any of this information, it’s at their fingertips. (Also, it is literally at their fingertips - the website is optimized and responsive to mobile, so no matter where they are, if they can get the information they need.)

2. No matter if a business is location specific or not, customers are researching services online before they do business with you. A modern and appealing website will mean larger market share and more new client revenue.

3. The website is building their business platform and an audience that they can use to expand into other markets. Angie already has a pet training DVD that is available for sale, and this new website will help her build a larger audience (through her [blog](http://royalk9.ca/blog.html)) of interested people that she can offer the DVD to and to sell future products to. 

The overall lesson here is this: even if your business is 100% local, having a great online presence is increasingly important. It is the tool that will help you serve clients better, attract new clients, and to build a business asset that you can use to leverage for other goals.
