WordPress (the blogging and content management system) seems to be everyone’s website platform of choice these days.<!--more-->  It’s become so popular that some might think it’s the ONLY option for creating a website - but that’s far from reality. 

There are some good things about WordPress, but for us, they don’t outweigh the bad. WordPress is not our website platform of choice. Here’s why:

**BIGGEST REASON**: The standard functionality of WordPress doesn’t work for every business. We believe that technology should be built around your business, not the other way around. Your business has different operational, marketing, and content needs than other businesses. We build technology to reflect that.

Their standard admin (back end) can be hard to use for some people. We hear from clients that they often have to spend hours “hacking” WordPress to get it to do what they need it to. 

It would be easiest (for us) to supply everyone with a standard ‘out of box’ piece of software. But, we don’t do easy. We do what’s best for our clients. We also have a lot of absurdly smart programmers on our team who create custom solutions for us, and we like to see what pieces of genius they develop next. 

If we have a car dealership that needs a custom format to upload their inventory or a ski resort who wants social media deeply integrated into the site - or whatever the situation is - we can accommodate their specific needs.

**REASON #2**: A lot of WordPress’s functionality comes from installing plugins. Running a number of plugins has a few negative consequences:
* Plugins come from independent authors, so it’s important to research the quality and *security* of each one.
* Having too many plugins can slow down your site. If the load time increases too much, your (potential) clients will navigate away from the site… and never come back. We don’t want that to happen to you. 
* When plugins are updated (which they should be, if there is a security or feature change), it takes time to keep up with installing each one.

**REASON #3**: Its popularity is working against itself. WordPress has become a target for malware, hacked themes, corrupt plugins, and all sorts of other nonsense. Think of it like the PC vs Mac in terms of viruses. Since the majority of people use PC’s, hackers and spammers target their system because there are more opportunities (people) there.. Same thing for WordPress.

We’ve never been ones to do something just because it’s popular - and avoiding WordPress is one example of that. Have you ever made a business decision that went against popular thought?

**REASON #4**: At the same time, we don’t want to be closed minded. We use various management systems. Some are from scratch and some are systems like Drupal, Joomla, Expression Engine. Also, top platforms such as Code Ignitor, Larvel and countless others. The main point is: you are unique, and we work with what works for your situation.
