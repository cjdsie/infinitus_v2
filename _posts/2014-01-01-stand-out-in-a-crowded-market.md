It's tough being in a saturated market. When you have lots of competitors, it's not enough to let your product speak for itself. Don't wait for industry recognition come to you -- take action and make it clear why you're the obvious choice. Embrace these ideas to stand out in even the biggest sea of competitors.

**Invest in Packaging and Design**

You may not want to judge a book by its cover, but you're not going to grab a product off the shelf unless you notice it. Your packaging is your first impression, so make it's a good one that lasts.

I'm not just talking about physical products. In a way, your website is packaging. Your location is packaging. Even the way you dress is packaging. Customers use these things to build a narrative about your company, even before you've interacted. Good packaging makes sure this story isn't just accurate, but that it's the tale you want them to hear.

Remember: this needs to do more than draw attention. Even the most intriguing looking product won't go in the cart if there's no way to tell what it contains. The snazziest website won't convert leads if it's impossible to navigate. Invest in packaging that not only attracts, but is accessible and informative.

**Give Away Your Best Stuff**

Don't worry. I'm not asking you to stop charging for your product. I'm saying you must generate killer content for your website. Remember how I said you need good packaging? It's not worth a dime if no one ever sees it. If you want leads, give them a reason to show up.

Go look at your strongest competitor's website. Dollars to doughnuts, I'll bet they have a blog. Why? For the same reason you watch commercials. We're more than happy to be advertised to, as long as we get something out of it.

Consumers aren't stupid. They know your blog is all about generating leads, creating a unique selling proposition. But if you're giving away your best stuff, I promise you they won't care.

**Be Yourself**

Obvious, but true: you cannot create a unique selling proposition if you're not unique. Remain professional, but don't let that keep your passion from shining through your business. Yes, "branding" has become somewhat of a buzzword, but that doesn't make it any less important.

Become memorable by injecting your personality and quirks into your brand. Don't be faceless; create a company consumers can identify with. Be yourself and you're sure to stand out from the competition.

**Over Deliver on Delivery**

I'm not talking about making sure your packages arrive on time, although that certainly helps. If you really want to stand out in your industry, be generous. Give the customer more than they asked for, every time. This doesn't always need to cost: you can over deliver on customer service, reliability, or even community involvement.

Over delivery is entirely about exceeding expectations and impressing the customer. If you promised the moon, give away Mars as well. Let it be known that what separates you from your competitors is that the customer is your first priority.

I know that every industry is different. I know that some of these techniques will work better for some businesses and not others. But I also know that all of these ideas revolve around a singular concept: you can't stand out if you can't engage the consumer. You don't have to drown in a sea of competition-- you just need to find the unique selling proposition for you.
