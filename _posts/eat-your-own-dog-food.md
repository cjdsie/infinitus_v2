Have you met a doctor that smokes? How about a skinny chef? An interior designer with an ugly house?<!--more-->

In our world of digital marketing, our equivalent to an interior designer’s “ugly house” is a social media presence and/or a blog that hasn’t been updated in weeks, or (gasp) months. If you come across an interactive agency that sells clients on the benefits of social media, content marketing and having a stellar website - but their own platforms have seen less action than the ‘Math Club’ in high school, it just doesn’t look good. 

If you haven’t noticed we are extremely active online and it works. In the past two months we have hit over 11,000 unique visitors to our site with a lead conversion rate of 2.9%, over 1,100 Facebook fans and engagement rates that are well above average.

Many marketing agencies are guilty (and we’ve been in the same boat in the past) of not eating our own dogfood. If we are saying that Facebook converts users into customers we better have an active Facebook following that actively engages our audience. If you don’t eat your own dog food, how can anyone trust you? Essentially, you are saying one thing and living another thing. We live in a society where that isn’t acceptable. 

Now, in saying that, it’s very difficult to eat your own dog food sometimes. 

Life is busy. Juggling several projects at a time is hard. Great social media and content creation takes time. Nobody is going to die if you miss a Facebook post. 

We’ve struggled with this for years, but have found that if you do ‘eat your own dog food’, is not only rewarding, but it creates results through your customers trusting you even more. 

So, whatever your business is, make sure that you are practicing what you preach. The online world has amplified word of mouth more than ever, and has created a very transparent business climate. Don’t get caught with your pants down - or an “ugly house.”
