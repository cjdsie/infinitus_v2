A lot of businesses understand that social media marketing is a big opportunity to grow in 2014. After all, creating a page and publishing content is free (aside from time/talent).<!--more-->Unfortunately, since there is such a low barrier to entry, we see a lot of mistakes every day committed by well-meaning businesses and organizations. Be careful about this mistakes - they can do real harm to your business if you don’t correct  them. 

1. Social media can feel good - it’s something that is “good for your business” and you get to see updates about your friends, new babies, engagements and vacations in between your marketing work. However, spending too much time on social has a diminishing return for actual business results. Our favorite tip is to schedule your posts ahead of time. When you log on to social media, spend a short time interacting with your audience and then get off and get back to work. Also, be careful with how often you are posting - TOO many posts from a page is the [#1 reason people stop following brand](http://lab42.com/infographics/like-us).

2. Growing your audience for your business page can be a slow process (especially if you aren’t buying ads to boost your “likes” or “followers”). Some people get impatient with this process, and start looking for quick ways to reach more people. Often, this means they post their marketing messages on other pages, groups, or on their personal page to their friends. This behavior is going to annoy people and hurt your brand image - it’s not a short cut to social media success.

3. If you set up your page and only post once every week or so, you aren’t going to get a lot of results from social media. Like many things in life, what you get out of it depends on what you put in (to a point - see mistake #1). Success on social media is largely dependent on [how consistent you are](http://socialmediatoday.com/kanter/597356/one-simple-secret-social-media-success-post-consistent-content-your-audience-loves). Becoming rich and famous isn’t going to happen overnight - you’re going to have to work at it, and deliver value over time to attract a large audience. 

4. Have you had a difficult day? Had to work with a difficult customer? Sat in a long meeting? Upset about the latest political election? 99% of the time, DON’T post about it on social media. People aren’t attracted to whiners, complainers, or pity-parties. Every single message that you publish is being judged by your target audience. Every message builds or retracts from your brand. If you wouldn’t want your grandma or a lawyer to read the message, don’t post it.

5. You may have won “Friendliest Classmate” in high school, but at the end of the day, your social media efforts need to convert. Don’t get too tied up in likes, followers, reach, and engagement. It really comes down to figuring out if your activity on social media is positively affecting your Key Performance Indicators. If you can’t track sales or membership numbers back to your work on social, you probably need to rework your strategy.

6. Social media marketing isn’t really about you. It’s about the people that you help. Make sure that you are posting entertaining, educational or engaging content. The occasional promotional message is necessary, (see #5) but if that is **all** that you are posting, you are doing it wrong.

7. Don’t post inappropriate content (for your audience). Make a conscious decision about who you are targeting. If you have an adult-only audience, a cuss word every now and then might not hurt you. However, to be on the safe side, keep it appropriate for everyone. Avoid overly sexy images, swearing (too much), or offensive messages. Unless that’s your brand.
