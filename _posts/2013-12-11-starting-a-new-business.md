When it comes to starting a new business, execution is everything. A great idea may be the seed from which a successful company grows, but we know a lot of people with good ideas. (We have more than we’ll ever be able to use.) I’m willing to bet that you do, too.

Starting a new business and growing it into a profitable venture takes action. It completely depends on execution.

Of course, not everyone who has a good business idea is in a position to change directions and focus all of his resources on that new company. And, many won’t have significant resources to risk. That’s okay.  It makes sense to start small and test before pouring too much time and money into a plan that may change as you test and learn.

Here are a few basic steps toward starting a new business that will allow you to move forward and refine your concept:

1. **Check out the competition** – If there’s already a successful business (or several) in your space, that doesn’t mean your idea won’t pay off. It does mean, however, that you’ll have to think about what’s going to set your business apart and help prospects choose you.
2. **Get a website** – Most prospects today—both business customers and consumers—begin their search for goods and services online. That’s great news for today’s entrepreneur, because it’s much quicker and easier to set up a website than to rent and setup the physical location that would have been required to start most businesses just a decade ago.
3. **Create an offer** – Creating an offer serves two important purposes when you’re starting a new business. One is obvious: it gives prospective clients something to act on. The other, though, is just as important: crafting your offer forces you to think concretely about exactly what you’re offering, what it’s worth and what it’s going to cost you to deliver.
4. **Find a few customers** – Yes, "a few".  In the long run, of course, you’ll want a full client base. But, starting small makes sense. You’re still refining your processes and/or your product, and you’re probably doing it all yourself at this stage. Take the time to perfect your offerings with a small number of clients; if you can find a few you’ve worked with before who already trust you and will be honest in their feedback, all the better.

The bottom line is that if you’re starting a new business, the most important thing you can do is…start a new business.  You can refine as you go, add staff as necessary and expand or change your offerings. But, there’s only one way that your idea can become a profitable business, and that’s when you take the first steps.
