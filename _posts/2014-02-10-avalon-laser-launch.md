If you can spare a minute, please head over to their site or one of their social media pages to share a enthusiastic “Congratulations!” with them. If you’ve ever launched a website, you know the amount of work and details that goes into a project of this size. 

It’s a great situation when we are trusted with a complete marketing picture for a client. For ALH, our core work together has been a complete redesign, copywriting and strategy for the website. From there, our work has branched out to include office signage, printed materials, digital advertising management, social media marketing and content marketing. 

Although the site just launched this week, we’re already excited about the results we’ve been seeing. We’ll share the official numbers on their portfolio page when that launches, but we wanted to chat a little bit about the strategy in this post. 

From the client discovery session, our first step was to define the brand and voice. We didn’t want to change the current logo or color scheme, but we did need to modernize the design elements and work on the brand message and personality to create more of an emotional connection between their clients and the business.

When it comes down to it, health is a deeply personal thing. Your good health is what allows you to enjoy the activities you are passionate about, interact and play with your family, and live life to the fullest. If something like a pain or injury is holding you back, all you can think about is getting back to full health. Because of this idea, we centered the marketing messages around “Get Back to You.” Or, “Get back to Hiking.” “Get back to enjoying winter.” The message leaves a lot of room for variation and customization. 

We’ve also been heavily focusing on the content. We spent a lot of time working to make the copywriting and voice on the website was great, and have been publishing bi-weekly blog posts for content marketing. This effort will continue to build their website traffic and their position as an authority in the health industry here in St. John’s. 

Most recently, we set out to create a brochure of the business. However, we realized that a brochure doesn’t serve their CLIENTS in the best way possible - who actually reads a brochure nowadays? So instead, we created a 20 page magazine with health articles and information that their clients will find both entertaining and educational.
