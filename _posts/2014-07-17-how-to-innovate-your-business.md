Innovation. When most business leaders hear that word, they automatically think about the technical, difficult aspects of it: R&D pros in lab coats, geeks tweaking code in front of computers, white boards filled with scrawled messages, ideas, and thoughts. And then, most business leaders dismiss the idea of innovation as something that bigger, more high-tech businesses do. 

And that’s a shame.

I’m here to offer a very different explanation of what innovation really is. More importantly, how you can use it for your organization-- no matter the size of your budget. 

<dl class="definition">
	<dt><dfn>innovation</dfn>[in-uh-vey-shuh n]</dt>
	<dd>noun<br>
		1. something new or different introduced</dd>
</dl>

The dictionary.com definition doesn’t offer much help. Something “new or different” could be a lot of things. Does changing the brand of coffee in the break room count? How about a new hire? Or adding social media to your marketing mix?

These are all new and different... but are they really examples of actual innovation?

Let’s add an element to our definition as it applies to organizations: **value**. Innovation is something new or different that adds value to your customer’s lives.

To start, let’s look at some businesses who didn’t innovate. 

Think about railroads in the last century and a half. The CEOs and bigwigs were arrogant enough to think that their product was irreplaceable. They were on the top of the world with gigantic profits rolling in. Looking at the world today, that’s not the case any more. So what happened? People didn’t stop needing to go from one place to another, they didn’t stop needing their goods to be transported… but new and different options -- like cars and airplanes -- came along that provided a better value to customers. Cut and dry: the railroad industry failed to innovate and paid a dear price for it. 

Take the innovation struggles of the music industry-- it’s happening right now! They’ve always been in the business of records, concerts, and radio plays. Now that others -- like iTunes and Pandora -- have changed the way that music is delivered, the record labels and execs are scrambling to figure out what to do to continue making the profits they did 10 years ago. Time will tell if they make it out alive.

(And don’t forget about the analog camera and film, movie rental, blacksmithing, and wagon wheel industries. They’ve all gone the way of the dodo, too.)

**Failure to innovate doesn’t discriminate.** ([tweet that!](http://ctt.ec/kge5O)) It can affect the oldest and biggest industries. The most successful, promising ones. It can affect your organization. 

Now that we covered the “what” and “why,” here comes the “how.”

Building innovation into your organization comes from shifting your focus from the products you sell to the people that you serve. 

Innovation isn’t a function of R&D-- that’s usually too product-focused. Innovation is a product of marketing and strategy. It means that you need to intimately understand your customers and what they want from you.

The railroad industry was really in the business of providing transportation. The music industry is really in the business of providing accessible entertainment (same goes for the movie rental business). Film cameras are in the business of preserving memories. 

Our business is INFINITUS Marketing + Technology. We sell technology, marketing strategy, and execution, but we’re really in the business of moving organizations forward. We do this by improving their profitability, helping them overcome obstacles, and grow. 

Designing and developing websites isn’t going to be a sustainable business. The technology is going to change. The way we communicate and interact with brands and businesses will change (again). It has in the past, and it will again in the future. 

To repeat, we’re not in the business of building websites or social media. Those are just the tools we use to help organizations grow, innovate, and increase profitability. The great news is, we’ll survive whatever comes next because we’re willing and able to leverage the tools necessary to provide value to our clients. 

Is your organization ready? Have you adapted to the current times, or are you still hanging on to the way things were done 5 or 10 years ago?

When you get crystal clear about who you are serving and what value you provide to their lives, you have the room to imagine how you could do that in new, different ways that provide even more value to them.

And that, my friend, is innovation.
