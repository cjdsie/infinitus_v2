Chances are, you have a blog that has a lot of great stuff on it. 

You’ve got knowledge and advice that’s valuable and important for your readers. But is it accessible? Is it digestible? With just a few small changes, you can make sure that your readers are able to find your work and interested enough to hang around and read it!

**Be Visual**<br/>
Think about wildly popular giants like Pinterest and Buzzfeed: both have highly visual interfaces. Even Facebook and Twitter have gotten on board and have tweaked their sites by giving more screen space to graphics. Put your best digital foot forward and make sure that each of your posts has at least one interesting, quality graphic that is ready to go when your readers pin, tweet, or post your awesome content!

**Include a Call to Action**<br/>
Your audience is reading your blog because they’re interested in what you have to say.  You might be giving advice on a vitamin supplement or explaining the difference between two breeds of dogs. If you want your readers to stick around, ensure that they know why they’ve just spent time reading your blog post.

It’s your job to connect the dots from your knowledge to your audience’s action. Give them the answer to the question, “So what?” So what does your advice about vitamins mean for your readers? What does it matter if a Rottweiler is different from a Chocolate Lab?  Give them concrete action steps, and they’ll keep coming back for more.

**Improve Your Headline**<br/>
Look at a few headlines from your blog posts. Are the posts informative or are they cutesy? It might seem like a good idea to have opaque, creative titles (after all, it does help to give your blog a voice and tone), but trust us—it does nothing for your readers or search engines.
 
Make sure that your titles reach out to your readers (and potential audience)! You might notice that our post titles are pretty straight-forward; they tell you exactly what you’re going to find in each post. An improved headline is great for your readers—most people will skip over your post if they don’t really understand what it’s going to be about.  If that happens, you’re losing out on potential readers and customers! And, a post with a headline that has keywords in it is going to surface in a search engine a lot faster and more accurately.  That means more visibility for your brand!

**Link within Your Blog**<br/>
Remember our post about [bounce rates](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/high-bounce-rate)? There are a few things you can do to keep people poking around on your blog, but one of the best strategies is to link to other posts within your post. (Just like we did here!) The idea is, if your readers are interested in what your post is about, they will be interested with another similar post you provide. Sneaking in links within your post also helps to improve your SEO. But, of course, most importantly, it puts your knowledge and expertise at your readers’ fingertips!

It may feel overwhelming at first to incorporate all of these tips at once, especially if you’re new to blogging. Focus on one of the tips for a month and take note of how it improves your posts and audience reach. As you get more comfortable, add another tip, and then another… until you’re a blogging pro!
