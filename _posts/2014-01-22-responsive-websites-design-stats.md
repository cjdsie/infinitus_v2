Can you imagine life without all of the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect?  
… Sliced bread.  
… Modern plumbing.  
… Color TV.  
… Cars.
… Airplanes.   
… Cell phones.  
… Ability to buy things online.  
… Power locks and windows.  
… The ability to skip commercials on TV.  
… The ability to check the weather whenever the whim strikes us.  
… Books and magazines delivered to e-readers in an instant.  
… Keep up with friends and family around the world on social networks.  
… Get up-to-minute (or up to second) information about breaking news.  
… Dishwashers. (Seriously. Don’t take yours for granted. We’ve been hand washing for the past few weeks, and it’s a painfully slow chore.)

Add to the list: responsive website design.

**First of all, what is responsive web design?**

In a nutshell, “responsive design” is a website that is developed to be fluid to fit the screen size that you are viewing the it on. Just a few years ago, all of our Internet browsing was done on roughly the same size desktop computer, and it didn’t require any thought. 

Now, people are using smart phones, mini tablets, full size tables, laptops and giant screens to browse the web. A [recent study](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Here-s-How-Many-Times-People-Switch-Devices-In-A-5111503.php) found that people switched between different screen sizes/devices an average of 21 times per hour. 

Imagine your target client - let’s call her Jamie - and her typical day. When she rolls over to shut off her (cell phone) alarm to start the day, she’s probably groggily skimming through her emails and Facebook to make sure she hasn’t missed anything. As she eats breakfast, she might be logging her calories and nutrients on an app on her iPad. On the way to work, she’s streaming Internet radio via bluetooth in her car. At work, she bounces between her laptop, desktop and cell phone - depending if she is at her desk, meeting with a client, or killing time before lunch. At home, she’s reading a book on her eReader, doing some shopping on her iPad, and finishing up some last minute work on her home computer. 

We consume digital information in a constant stream from our many devices all day long. We don’t skip a beat. This has become our natural rhythm of life.

That is, until we stumble on a website that doesn’t work quite right…   
… We can’t read the text without zooming in and out constantly.   
… The links are too small to click with our fingers.   
… Images and headlines are cut off.  
… Forms ask us to type in our life story on our teeny screen keyboards just to register for the site.   
… Or worse, all we see is a blank white box of an old flash website.   

At that point, our attention is lost. We go back to happily bouncing between digital content streams that DO cater to us. We go back to interacting with companies, brands and apps that understand our lifestyle. 

**Don’t be that website.** 

## Responsive Website Statistics

We manage and report stats on over 250 websites, so we sat down to do our own research. If you are doubting that this is actually how your target customers are living life - sit up and pay attention. 

Over all of our managed sites,  **mobile viewing spiked from 21% to 34%** from 2012 to 2013. On retail sites, mobile visitors has reached an average of **52%**.

In other words, somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 people who find you online are seeing your website on a mobile device. [(tweet this)](http://ctt.ec/AfamP) THAT’S HUGE.

If your site isn’t perfectly responsive, you are telling up to HALF of your prospects that you don’t care about them and their lifestyle. You’re telling them that you don’t understand them. That you don’t deserve their business. 

A mobile responsive website is no longer just an option. It is a requirement for operating a modern business. 

**Here’s your homework:**
Test your website on multiple devices (iPhone, Android, iPad, Laptop). How does it look? Is everything usable? 
Check out your bounce rate for mobile viewers vs. desktop visitors. If it’s significantly higher on mobile, you have some design/content issues.
Getting a mobile responsive website is easier than you think (with our help). [Contact us](/contact) to see what it’ll take for you.

We don’t want your business be the “hard to work with” option. Let’s leave unsliced bread, hand washing, and smoke signals to the history books.
