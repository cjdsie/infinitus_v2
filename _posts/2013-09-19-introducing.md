On October 1st, we are launching our new brand across Atlantic Canada. It’s a new face for much of what we’ve provided in the past like web development, marketing and design. The change reflects a renewed passion and direction for combining marketing + technology to conquer your business goals.

We’ve brought together the brightest minds to create...

**INFINITUS Marketing + Technology**.

What is INFINITUS? Well, first off - it’s Latin for limitless - something that we strive for every day. We don’t just design and build websites; we create powerful online strategies and integrated digital campaigns.

I hope you’ll join us in celebrating our launch. Connect with us on social media:

**So, what makes us awesome?**

1. Our team: Yes, we know everyone says this. But, our team really is amazing. We are based in Newfoundland and Labrador NL, but have hand picked brilliant minds in marketing + technology from across Canada, the U.S. and Europe. We’re small enough to be nimble, but have the depth to match the right experts to your project.

2. Our attitude: “Can’t” and “how it’s always been done” don’t jive with us. We challenge tradition when it isn’t working as well as it should. Thankfully, we also have enough years of experience not to change things just for the sake of “new” and “fresh”.

3. Balance: Many agencies lean to the creative or the technology side of things, but we recognize that one doesn’t work without the other. We’ve built our systems, processes and team to give both equal weight. 

If you have a project or a challenge that’s been on your mind - get in touch! We’d love to talk it over with you and see if we’d be a good fit to work together.
