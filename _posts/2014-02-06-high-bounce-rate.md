Sexy, right?

First, a definition: The bounce rate of your website is the percentage of visitors who navigate away from your website after only seeing one page. 

It’s an extremely important metric to measure because it shows how engaging your website is. Since visitors can enter your site on any page (due to SEO, targeted ads, linking, etc.) each page has its own bounce rate. 

If your bounce rate is high, it can point to a larger problem with your marketing, website, or brand. Worst of all, it means that the effort and investment that you are spending on driving people to your website is being wasted. No bueno. 

Before we go on, we do need to talk about an exception. Some sites are used primarily as a quick reference point, and the primary goal is not necessarily to encourage browsing. For example, if you click into Wikipedia, you are likely looking for a quick answer to a question. In the case of a reference site or a blog post, a high bounce rate - as long as it’s coupled with a high visitor return rate - is OK. 

###So, what is considered a high bounce rate?

It can vary widely, but so you can compare your number against *something*, the average bounce rate from a sample of ~30 of our sites last month was 41%. Some sites were higher, some lower. 

“According to an Inc.com article: "As a rule of thumb, a **50 percent** bounce rate is average. If you surpass 60 percent, you should be concerned. If you're in excess of **80 percent**, you've got a major problem."

[Bounce rate - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate)

###What causes a high bounce rate?

A high bounce rate usually means one of two things:<br/>
1) You’re attracting the wrong people to your site<br/>
2) You’re attracting the right visitors, but they don’t understand your value<br/>

 <p>#1 typically points to a marketing problem, #2 points to a website problem.</p>

If you suspect that there may be a marketing problem, dig into your referral sources. For example, we recently won a design award that sent a lot of traffic to our site. Since the traffic was other website designers, they weren’t necessarily interested in seeing our contact page or blog. They just stopped by quickly to check out the homepage and then they were on their way. This can also happen when you put out a press release. You’ll get a spike of traffic, but the traffic isn’t necessarily your best prospects, and they tend to bounce more often. 

If everything looks peachy with the site referrals and links, check out your demographics. Do lots of visitors come from locations that you don’t often serve? Or maybe some crazy search terms are directing people to your site? 

If you think that everything looks OK on the marketing side, it’s time to work on your design. Here are some questions to ask yourself:

Is your mobile bounce rate drastically higher than desktop viewers? If it is higher on mobile, is your site correctly optimized for phones and tablets?

**Next question:**

Can people immediately tell who you are and what you do when they first navigate to your site? 

Our File Sealer site is a good example of this. The bold headline across the top communicates how the site can benefit the viewer.

**Next, check out your links.** Do they invite people deeper into your site? Are they easy to find and accurately labeled? Is it clear where you want people to visit first?

On the Legendary Coasts site, the navigation is easy to see along the top. If viewers choose to scroll down, they’ll immediately have access to becoming a member or to click on an event or news item.

**Other questions to ask yourself:**

Will people trust you at a glance? 
Is your site well-designed and attractive?
Does it load quickly? 
Is your site readable and accessible on all devices?
Is your navigation in the top or left? (This is not the place to be creative.)
Are there any external site links on your site that are attracting too much attention?
