In the past few months, you might have noticed your audience interaction on your brand’s Facebook fan page has changed for the worse.

The reason? 

Facebook’s constantly changing algorithms that are trying to gently (or, more likely, frustratingly) push you towards clicking the “Boost Post” button and paying for visibility to your fans. Yeah. Visibility to the fans that already like your page and want to get updates from it.  
 
Never fear. Despite Facebook’s attempts to thwart your scope of influence, we’ve got steps you can take to increase your visibility to your fans.

**Share Like-Worthy Material**<br/>
Try this experiment with your personal Facebook account: Go to a fan page that you have liked but that never shows up in your newsfeed organically. Like or share one of their posts. Wait for about a day. Look again at your newsfeed-- notice anything different? That page that wasn’t in your newsfeed has suddenly sprung up.  When you interact with pages on Facebook, it is flagged to show up more often in your newsfeed.  The lesson? You need your audience to want to like, comment on, and share your post, and so you’ve got to engage them with your content.

**Analyze Your Insights**<br/>
So, how do you figure out what kind of engagement your audience enjoys?  Data! When you have a fan page, Facebook gives you the added bonus of analytics. When you’re in the administrative view of your fan page, click the “See Insights” button that appears in the upper right-hand corner.  The Insights page will give you an overview and breakdown of the analytics of your page. Who’s visiting? Where are they being referred from? What are they engaging on? It’s all there for you to look at and create an engagement plan from.

**Schedule Your Posts**<br/>
Now that you know what to share and when to share it, you’ve got to do it consistently. Did you know that Facebook has a built-in scheduler?  It’s inconspicuous, so chances are that you’ve seen it but have never clicked it. When you write a post, notice that there’s a clock icon in the lower left-hand corner. Click it and schedule away. This ensures that posts are being sent out even when you’re not shackled to a computer. Those auto-posts mean more eyes on your work and your brand. Remember to incorporate what you’ve learned from the Insights page and schedule posts for high-traffic times.
 
This is just scratching the surface of what you can do to make your page more engaging, interesting, and clickable for your audience. We’ll be back with more tips, but until then, spend some time experimenting with your statuses and post times. See how different topics and media (links, pictures, text, video) engage your audience and learn from it!
