Wouldn’t it be great if we could get paid for all of the things people tell us we “should” do to market our businesses online? 

You should have a website. You should sell on it. You should be on Facebook. Twitter. Pinterest. Google+. SnapChat (really?!). Instagram. You should be personable. Professional. Funny. Serious.

You should get professional photos taken. Hire a professional copywriter. Hire a professional designer. Book keeper. Shoe shiner. 

I mean, don’t you want to look successful?!

We’ve been guilty of this before too, so we’re not exempt from the madness. We are, however, going to do something about it on April 15th at 4PM NDT (2:30 EST). I hope you’ll join us.

Here’s what’s going down:

We’ve distilled our BEST advice about making your website work for you, in the most straightforward, easy to understand way. The knowledge comes from launching over 400 websites in the last 10 years (almost 50 in the last 6 months). 

You don’t need to be tech-savvy to benefit from this free training. You just need to have a website that you want people to take a specific action on (donate, hire you, buy something). 

Is that you?
