For many businesses, the About Page on their website is an afterthought. They know they need one, they just don’t give it the time it deserves. After all, there are a lot of other things to be done online to boost a brand—blog posts, social media, e-commerce. Don’t fall into the Ignore Your About Page trap! Instead, see it as the perfect opportunity to engage your audience and sell your brand.  Here are four ways our clients are presenting themselves and capitalizing on their About Pages.

**An Attention-Grabbing Graphic**<br>
The contrast and color in [Vigilant Management’s](http://www.vigilantmanagement.ca) About Page is stunning. (Notice how the color of the photo mirrors the color of their logo.) Paired with a call-out box and a quote, this page invites visitors to read it and remember it. What parts of your industry are interesting and exciting? How can you strategically use them to both visually set your business apart from others and make a strong, bold statement?

**Present Your Philosophy**<br>
What sets you apart from others in your industry is how you do things. And your methods are better, right? Explain how your brand is innovative, how you get stuff done, and why you do it that way. Spend some time explaining your approach, just like [Flow Consulting](http://www.flowconsult.ca) and give your clientele the whole story so they can make an informed decision. (They’re going to pick you!)

**Introduce Your Team**<br>
People are more likely to patronize companies with whom they feel a connection. Introducing your team is one way to begin that relationship. For [Avalon Laser Health](http://www.avalonlaserhealth.ca/), it is crucial that their clients are comfortable and confident in their team of health clinicians. Their about page features the photographs and credentials of each employee. (You’ll notice that we do this too! Meet our [whole team here](http://www.goinfinitus.com/team)!) Who are the people your clients will come in contact with? What do your clients need to know about them? How can you help to foster a human connection on your About Page?

**Give Information At-a-Glance**<br>
It’s likely that many of your visitors may not read every word on your webpage. Most web users will scan websites for the information they need. How can you slow them down? Offer small, digestible chunks of text with graphics. Make sure there’s space on the page so that your readers are not overwhelmed by text. [Royal K9](http://www.royalk9.ca) uses headings and graphics of the dog foods they offer for sale as a way to grab their audience and give them the information they’re looking for. If a visitor is glancing through your about page, what will they see? How can you break it up and make it more engaging?
