No… we’re not looking in your window. We use live cursor tracking, which means that when you visit  [golimitless.ca](http://golimitless.ca) or  [goinfinitus.com](/) we can view your entire session as if it was on your screen. How does this give us an advantage?

1. We can see tracking issues (ie. there were 4 responsive design issues that were fixed in the first 20 minutes of launch)
2. Usability is important: we can see if people are using our menus, clicking on our links, and otherwise navigating to the pages we want them to see
3. We can see what people try to click on (link or not). In some cases, we’ve added links where we didn’t have them originally.
4. We can see how far users scroll down the page, so we know what they’re actually reading

As a business, this method is key in the first hours of a website launch and on a monthly basis to ensure that what you do on the web is driven not just with expertise and experience, but driven by data created by your visitors.

For example, for website that is trying to drive sales, you intend for the user to find the “buy now” button and complete the transaction. For a nonprofit, your goal would be getting visitors to select the “donate” button. With cursor tracking, you can see the exact path that people take to get to those actions.

**Remember, you aren’t the customer. Your customers are.**

You’ll be amazed at the ways that people try to use your website, and the paths that they take that lead to a conversion. For example, if you knew that your "about" page was almost always the one people clicked on first, you could tailor that page to speak directly to a new user and introduce yourself. 

The  [golimitless.ca](http://golimitless.ca) website collected 11 registrations in the first few hours - some of which we would have lost if we hadn’t been able to make quick fixes in real time to our site. 

Are you sure your website is converting it’s visitors? If not, let’s talk.
