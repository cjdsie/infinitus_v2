Last week we released information on our  [Go Limitless workshop tour](http://www.golimitless.ca/) across the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (sidenote: go [sign up](http://www.golimitless.ca/)!). When we approached the development of the marketing strategy we wanted to use testing to make sure that the 140 tickets to sell, would sell.<!--more--> This is a constant job of ours, making sure that people that have a goal can get what they want.

One of the first tests we completed was testing the subject line of our eNewsletter that announced the workshop.

When we sent out the eNewsletter on October 22nd, we tested the subject line to a smaller audience before sending out to the rest of the list. Our eNewsletter list is just over 6,000 email addresses, and we tested the following email subject lines on 10% of the eNewsletter list: 
Email subject test A: “Get Results: What it takes in 2014” 
Email subject test B: “2014: Do you want results?” 

Can you guess which one worked the best? Within 30 minutes we found that #2 worked better. How much better? 6.6% open rate versus 5.6% open rate. 5 clicks versus 0. That’s a big difference isn’t it? Out of those 5 clicks we further tracked those users and one user subscribed to the updates list and another purchased a ticket to the 3-hour workshop. 

Think about that. By changing a couple words we went from a dud to a successful eNewsletter - if we didn’t track, I don’t believe we would ever get that sale (and the subsequent sales from sending out the successful email to the rest of the list).

**TAKEAWAY**: We’re finding that active subject lines work best to get the email opened. We speak directly to the ONE person who will be reading it (don’t ever write to a group, always write to one specific person). We ask them a question or tell them to take action - and that piques their interest to open the eNewsletter.  

**LEAVE A COMMENT**: Do you know what email subject worked best for your business or organization? What was it?
