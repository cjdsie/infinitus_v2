**In this episode you’ll learn (amongst other things…):**
  
- What a ‘co-working space’ is
- How co-working can help entrepreneurs for little investment or commitment
- How it’s proven, operating from a co-working space can help you generate new ideas
- How a co-working space can introduce you to people outside of your industry
- How Chris ‘presold’ memberships ahead of opening to gauge interest and raise funds “We really didn’t know how to build this for the local community, so we asked them.”
- That Chris spent time speaking to established co-working space firms to learn from them
- Being an entrepreneur has its own hardships; being part of a like-minded community helps
- The 6 areas in which co-working benefits people “Mission, networks, ideas, collaboration, money and… happiness”
- “If those 6… aren’t enough to convert the unconverted then I don’t know what is.”
- In a study, 85% of members said they had collaborated with at least one other member
- A global study found 75% of coworkers expected to increase their earnings over the next year
- Larger organizations can’t ignore their massive overheads, nor avoid the possibilities of allowing their staff to find co-work spaces
- That Kaye’s husband cooks amazing lamb (hey, didn’t say everything you’d learn would be useful) :)
