Do you operate an Instagram profile for your business? 

We’ve talked a lot about [Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/3-steps-to-creating-an-engaging-twitter-presence). We’ve even spent time talking about the [do’s and don’ts of LinkedIn](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/lessons-from-kelly-blazek). But we’ve been quiet on the Instagram front for too long! 

Instagram has about 150 million active users per month, about 75 million of them are active every day, and the average user spends about [257 minutes on the app per month](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/important-instagram-stats/#.UxuBLfldXKg). Those statistics are pretty compelling by themselves. But in case you’re not convinced, or if you’re not sure that your brand would translate well on Instagram, here are 3 indicators that you should dive in to the point-and-shoot waters:

**Your Business is Visual**<br>
Do you create things that are photo-friendly? Would the day-to-day of your operation make for interesting pictures?  Do people show-off your products? If you’ve answered yes to at least one of those questions, your business might make a splash in Instagram. Using the platform to highlight a new product, announce a sale, or show a behind-the-scenes look of your business can really help to maintain and grow your brand’s narrative. Even simply having an accessible handle allows your customers to snap photos of your services and tag your work! And that’s free, visual advertising!

**Your Business Caters to Young People**<br>
Over 90% of Instagram’s users are in the 18-to-35 age bracket. (That’s roughly 135 million people, if you didn’t feel like crunching the numbers.) [68% of users are female, too](http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-demographics-2013-12). If one or both of those are your business’ target demographic and you’re not on Instagram, what are you waiting for?
  
**Your Social Media Presence is Strong**<br>
If you already tweet, post, and pin, you’re already primed to click and tag! You already know how social media works and you do a great job at promoting your brand and staying on message. Cross-marketing your social media will garner you Instagram followers (who already believe in and love your brand) in no time, but it will also open you up to new followers-- and of course, potential customers. 

If this article has you considering a foray into the world of Instagram, reserve your handle and start your account-- even if you’re not completely committed to the idea just yet. Spend some time seeing what brands in your industry-- both those similar in size and larger than yours-- are doing. How are they interacting with their followers? How are they using the platform to market their product? What kinds of hashtags and messages do you see popping up? Get a feel for the platform and its use, and if you’re feeling adventurous, jump in!
