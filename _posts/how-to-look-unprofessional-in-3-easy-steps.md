Is your brand unprofessional online?  

It might be a difficult question to answer, especially if you have a nagging suspicion that it is. In this fast world of social media, the lines and distinctions can seem blurred and fuzzy. After all, most brands are more at ease on social media than they are in formal advertising. While many companies have relaxed their tone and voice in advertising and media campaigns, some rules do still apply to ensure a pleasant experience for customers.

Brands that flirt with the line tend to do at least one of these three things:

**Consistently Use Poor Conventions**<br/>
The internet is a place of relaxed grammar, punctuation, and spelling… for individuals. The rules are still different for businesses. Don’t get sucked into the cult of incomprehensible language. Do your best to make sure that every post, message, email, and tweet is polished and correct. Double-check your spelling and consult a copy editor if you’re unsure about the finer points of grammar. It will help to legitimize your brand and ensure that your message is clear for your consumers. 

**Post Inappropriate Content**<br/>
The tough thing about social media is that one post or tweet can be duplicated in an instant and can never really be deleted completely. A moment of impropriety or anger, or a poorly phrased joke can cause a lot of unwanted problems for you. Many businesses have made blunders while figuring out the world of social media.

Not convinced? Think about Kenneth Cole’s PR nightmare. During the Egyptian uprising in Tahrir Square—as people were dying and being beaten— the fashion designer tweeted, “Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online…” The backlash against Kenneth Cole was immediate and strong.  While Kenneth Cole, a fashion and business empire, survived the PR nightmare, smaller companies might not be able to withstand a moment of stupidity on social media. The message? Think twice about what you post, and when in doubt, don’t.

**Steal Someone Else’s Work**<br/>
Imitation is sincerest form of flattery. But copying is just, well, stealing. Especially if you’re just starting out, you may be tempted to swipe ideas from more successful brands. Don’t give in to the temptation. Even ignoring the morality of the situation, it is inevitable that someone will notice and call you out for your plagiarism.  Take the case of DNKY. The clothing brand had such a crisis on their hands last year when they used pictures from Facebook phenom, Humans of New York, in store displays without paying the photographer for his work. The public outcry was thunderous and immediate. Don’t subject yourself to a similar situation: create your own content and only take credit for your work.
 
Taking care to steer clear of these three gigantic pitfalls will keep your brand attracting clients and potential customers for the right reasons.
