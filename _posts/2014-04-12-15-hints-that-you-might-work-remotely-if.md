It’s no secret that INFINITUS’ entire team is made up of remote workers. We think that this is what makes us an effective and relevant team—we’re able to [hire the best people for the right jobs](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/benefits-to-hiring-freelance-employees). We’re not relegated to the pool of job seekers in any one place. Rather, our pool of job seekers is the world!

There are so many great benefits to working from home—for both the employee and the business. Often though, articles that talk about working remotely focus on the numbers and stats—how much productivity is gained, how much money is saved, how much the employee’s carbon footprint shrinks. But fewer people talk about the humanity and day-to-day of working from home.
 
Here’s what we’ve encountered while working from home—both the funny and serious. You just might work remotely if…

1. …you’ve never met your team in person.
2. …you take your lunch break but spend it doing laundry and cleaning the bathroom.
3. …you sometimes show up to work in PJs.
4. …you’ve never had a snow day.
5. …your commute is 5 minutes—from the bedroom, to the coffee maker, to the office.
6. …you feel crushing guilt when you aren’t working because—hey!—you could always work a few more minutes!
7. …you and your teammates work in 5 different time zones and 10 different countries.
8. …you love that you never have to take a sick day, but also hate that… you never have to take a sick day.
9. …every day is business casual!
10. …your dog has howled during or your child has wandered into a Skype meeting. And it’s always at the most inopportune time.
11. …you don’t know when the traffic report comes on TV. And you’re not sure of the last time you drove in rush hour.
12. …you often forget to get a glass of water because you’re that immersed in what you’re doing.
13. …you can’t remember the last time you picked up the phone for a business call. That’s what Skype, email, and instant messaging are for, right?
14. …your business suits are collecting dust in your closet.
15. …you can set your own schedule—and you do!
 
So, what do you think? Which of these rang true to you? What can you add to our list? We’d love to hear your stories and thoughts about working from home!
