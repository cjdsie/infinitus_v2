**Bad--or No-- Product Photos**<br>
Steve Jobs once said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” The first step to convincing your customers that your product is the one they want?  Have quality, flattering photographs of your products on your website. Remember, the web is becoming increasingly more visual. The right photographs could make your products (and your business) go viral. Not sure how to achieve this on your own? Consider consulting and hiring a professional photographer.

**Catering to Everyone**<br>
Businesses that try to cater to everyone’s interests, likes, and dislikes fail quickly. You don’t need everyone to like or need your product. You need a focused group of consumers to love your business. Know and own your demographic-- be proud of the people that buy from you! And focus your advertising to meet their needs and questions.
  
**Ignoring the Power of the Internet**<br>
Embrace the internet: it is not the wave of the future, it’s the here and now. If you’re unsure how to create a dynamic, forward-thinking presence online, don’t worry-- we have you covered! [Contact us for your free consultation today](http://www.goinfinitus.com/contact).

**Never Admitting Fault**<br>

According to research, consumers view businesses that admit fault and do not place blame on outside factors as more [trustworthy](http://blog.bufferapp.com/10-simple-ways-to-get-more-customers-using-psychology). Rectify situations and apologize when necessary. It will benefit your company in the long run.

**Dismissing Inbound Marketing**<br>
How do you advertise your business online? Maybe you use Google AdWords or other spot ads to get your message out-- after all, many brands do! However, did you know that 70% of online adults trust recommendations from friends and relatives, but only [10% trust website ads](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-the-consumer-mind/201312/do-you-trust-the-internet)? Instead of spending time (and money) on ad campaigns, you might want to shift your attention to inbound marketing. Creating buzz through social media and blogs is a way to continue to advertise, but to do so in a more authentic, personal way.
