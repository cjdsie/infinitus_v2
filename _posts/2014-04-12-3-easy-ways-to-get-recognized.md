...Then why are you doing that to your online content? That’s right; you may be making it more difficult for potential customers to find your brand. If you’re not thinking about backlinks, your brand is behind the proverbial sofa. Let’s get it away from the dust-bunnies!
 
We all know that SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is important. Most people know that keywords are an important part of SEO. But did you know that backlinks also figure into the equation?  Backlinks are created when URLs from your website are present on other sites. The idea is this: Google awards sites that have a variety high-quality backlinks because it shows that your work is shareable and valuable. The problem is that, by and large, you have to rely on other people to want to link to your work on their site. So, how do you get other people to create those backlinks?

**Feature Others**<br/>
The best way to get goodwill is to give it. Making strategic professional and personal connections is—believe it or not—still very important on the internet. Feature a guest poster or review of another brand or professional in your industry. By featuring others, you’re letting them know that you’re here and that you’re “in it” for more than just what you can get.  They’ll be more interested in what you have to offer, and, since they’ll be more familiar with what you do, they may be more inclined to share your work with their audience.

**Create Something Interactive**<br/>
Get those creative juices flowing! Make something interactive for your audience—maybe a quiz, a responsive map or graph, or a video. Make something that people will want to share with others, something that starts a conversation and keeps it going. If you need a little inspiration, browse [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com) and [Zimbio](http://www.zimbio.com), two sites that rock the social media world on a regular basis.

**Give Your Knowledge**<br/>
What do you have that is valuable to others? Your knowledge! The possibilities for this tip are virtually limitless. Using your specialized, industry-specific knowledge, create a comprehensive eBook, list, or infographic that others can download and share. This is your moment to give the internet a taste of how fantastic your brand is and to keep them coming back for more! Once you’ve created your product, go the extra step and contact other similar websites, blogs, and brands to see if they’ll share some of that karmic love and plug your free download.
 
So, what can you do today to start improving the amount and quality of backlinks that are out there in the internet’s ether? 

Choosing a strategy that fits your brand is just as important as actually executing it. 

What seems authentic and “you”?
