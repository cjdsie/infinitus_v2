With work picking up after our [launch](lessons-learned-after-2-weeks-and-2000-unique-visitors), we’ve been producing an amazing amount of content. Case in point: in November, we’re launching 17 websites. That’s a ton of code, design, copy and strategy happening. In the process, we’re refining our processes and have learned a few things along the way. 

![alt Secrets to Getting More Done Faster](/images/create-faster.jpg "Secrets to Getting More Done Faster") 

**First lesson**: Drink coffee. (Kidding. Drink green tea. It’s better for you.)

**Real first lesson**: Create tight deadlines. In the book,  [Scarcity Having Little Means Much](http://www.amazon.ca/Scarcity-Having-Little-Means-Much/dp/0805092641), the the author talks about how people create the same quality of content no matter if they are given 3 weeks or 3 days to complete (within reason). Think back to your college days - no matter how long you were given to complete that “semester long” project, you probably amazed yourself at how much you could get done in the final two weeks when it really counted.

We’ve adopted the idea that people - no matter how awesome - are procrastinators by nature. Since our work is based on producing a lot of in-depth custom products, we need to speed up the process. The way we do this is to create lots of quick deadlines for each chunk of the project. 

**Second lesson**: Of course, working fast isn’t enough. We still have to create amazing work. To do this, we deliberately build time into the schedule for iteration and revision. We have quality controllers, programmers, copywriters, designers, and even the occasional “Mom test” to review each piece of work from their unique perspective. Every iteration a project goes through, it gets better. Even after the launch, our sites include a maintenance package where we monitor, test, refine, and update sites throughout time. 

**Third lesson**: Give your priority project the focus it needs. When we launched the  [Go Limitless](http://www.golimitless.ca) conference series, we created an aggressive schedule of deadlines to complete each of the milestones. It was aggressive in that we were building out the entire marketing plan and website in 5 days (good thing we’re professionals at this!). It seemed insurmountable at first, but we also gave the key players on the project the space that they needed to get it done. When we were considering adding another project in the same time frame, we realized that Limitless had priority and pared down that new project idea.

**Fourth lesson**: Make time to communicate. When you’re juggling 324 balls at once, dropping one would be catastrophic. We do two things to avoid ball-droppage. First, we have running lists (Google Drive is our best friend) of next steps, deadlines, and deliverables. At least weekly, we check in to build out the week (see lesson #3 - giving each priority project the space it needs).

The second thing that we’ve had to do is to bring someone in, in a project management capacity. Working with a team of freelancers  [is awesome](benefits-to-hiring-freelance-employees), but more work means more people to do the work, and an increased complexity in coordination. We recognized this early and have started incorporating a manager for some of the larger projects.
