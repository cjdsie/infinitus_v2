Maintaining social media can be an overwhelming task-- especially if you’re doing it right! It can feel like a never-ending hamster wheel of comments and notifications, especially if you’re managing your social media and running your business. 

Remember, you can’t eat an elephant all at once; you can only do so by taking bites. And the bite out of the social media elephant is going to be just five minutes a day for two weeks. You can handle that!

**Target**<br>
First of all, if you’re only dedicating five minutes to social media a day, you need to be strategic and smart about it. You can’t work on all of them in five minutes; you’ve only got time for one. Let’s focus on the platform that has the most growth potential but the fewest followers out of all of your social media platforms. 

Got a platform in mind that fits the parameters? Good.  Don’t get distracted. Stick to that one.

**React**<br>
During your five minutes, you are going to be focused and strategic in your comments. Take care of your customer questions first-- give the information they need or direct them to where they can get it. Then deal with any praise you might have received. Depending on the platform, liking or retweeting might be appropriate. Use your best judgment.
  
**Post**<br>
Create one new thing-- post a question, a quote, a picture, or a cross-promotion. Make sure that your post is succinct, thought-out, and aligned with your brand’s vision and strategy.  If you’re not sure what to post about, read this article on the [3 Es of content marketing](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/the-3-es-of-content-marketing)! We think it’ll give you a few ideas!

**Interact**<br>
Find a few brands or personalities that align with your brand and are industry-specific. For example, if you’re a restaurateur, following restaurants and chefs-- both local and otherwise-- is a great way to see what’s happening in your field and potentially make connections. Take a moment and make your presence known on one of the profiles you follow-- like, retweet, repin, or comment. If you comment, be sure to leave a meaningful message without sounding desperate.

Remember, the more “stuff” you create-- posts, statuses, comments-- the more opportunity you have for people to see your brand. By dedicating focused, strategic time to your platform every day, you’re creating more visibility and opportunities for people to interact with you and your brand.
