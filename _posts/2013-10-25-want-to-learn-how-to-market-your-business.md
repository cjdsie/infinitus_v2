Let’s get right down to business. We chat with clients all of the time who understand that this whole online marketing thing is important, but aren’t quite sure how to put it all together into one cohesive, DOABLE plan.

Inspired by the questions we hear over and over, we’ve decided to pull back the curtain on our ten years of marketing + technology experience, and show you how to actually get results online. 

###Introducing… the Go Limitless by INFINITUS Marketing + Technology live workshop, “Get Results: What it takes in 2014”

**Who is it for?**

Entrepreneurs, owners and managers who:

1. Want to attract customers with a “24/7 salesperson” (hint: your website) that is always available, always says the right thing, and gets customers ready to hand you money

2. Are worried their competitors are leaving them behind online

3. Want to know what SEO, SMM, and SEM are, and more importantly, if they will make a difference to their situation

4. Are tired of trying different marketing platforms and tactics only to see lackluster results and are ready for a consistent strategy 


**Bottom line:**

Even if you don’t know your conversion rate from your bounce rate and don’t have a technological savvy bone in your body, this workshop is for you. We’ll teach you the exact process we use with each of our clients to get results online. 

**YES, that’s me! What exactly is it?**

Go Limitless is a half-day (3 hour) live workshop tour across NL, Canada where you’ll learn about interactive marketing + technology, and how to use it in your business or organization. You’ll leave the event with your own marketing plan that you can start putting into motion right away. 

**When & Where is it?**

Dates range from November 25 - December 3, 2013. We have events scheduled in Corner Brook, Deer Lake, Grand Falls-Windsor, Gander, Clarenville, and St. John’s / Mount Pearl. 

**How much?** 

Each ticket costs $399, with a special discount for current INFINITUS clients.

**Friendly note:** don’t procrastinate! For each of the locations, we’re only taking a maximum of 24 registrants. We’d hate if you decided to come, only to see the tickets are sold out in your city. We can’t wait to help you grow your business or organization in 2014. Go and [register now](http://www.golimitless.ca/)!
