Pinterest, the fastest growing social media site, is also one of the simplest social media platforms. 

Still, there are a lot of ways to grow and shape your Pinterest account, if you know some of the site’s little-known features.  We’ve got four secrets of the trade that, when used, will help to set your account apart!

**Board Beautification**<br>
While you can’t arrange the order of individual pins within a board, you can rearrange the order of your boards on your profile. Just click and drag to their desired location!  You want to arrange your boards strategically so that users looking at your profile see the most pinnable stuff immediately. What boards are the most useful to your audience? Which are maintained the most? Which have the best pictures or actionable content for your audience?

**Rich Pins**<br>
In the last year, Pinterest has launched completely free business accounts. While you have to jump through a few hoops (including installing a tracking code onto your websites and verifying it) to change your account to a business one, brands with business accounts have the opportunity to take advantage of Rich Pins. There are currently five categories: Movie Pins, Recipe Pins, Product Pins, Article Pins, and Place Pins.  Rich pins make anything pinned from your website more useful because they automatically add extra information. For example, Product Pins automatically add the price and availability to a pin. Rich pins also brand every pin with your website’s favicon and your website’s name.  Rich pins take up slightly more screen space on Pinterest’s newsfeed and they invite pinners to click and visit your website now.

**Analytics**<br>
With a business account, you are also able to access the analytics of your pins and your boards. Pinterest makes these metrics available: site metrics, most recent pins, most repinned, and most clicked. Pinterest keeps its records, so you are able to compare and contrast your analytics to other points in time and look at historical trends. The analytics section also allows you to export your stats to your computer so that you can really dig into them!

**Sourcing**<br>
Ever wonder what people are pinning from your site? While analytics can give you an overview, if you’re interested to see what’s being pinned in real time, type [http://www.pinterest.com/source/yourwebsite.com/](http://www.pinterest.com/source/yourwebsite.com/) into your address bar. (Make sure that you change”yourwebsite.com” to your website’s address.) You’ll be presented with a page of all of the pins from your site along with who pinned them, what boards they were pinned to, and any comments the pinners made. By the way, you can do this with any website—it doesn’t have to be your own. Use this to look for trends with websites that are similar to yours. What works? What doesn’t? How can you emulate the successes you’ve noticed?

Most likely, Pinterest will continue to unveil other tools and upgraded aspects of their interface to make the platform more user-friendly. When they do, you can be sure we’ll let you know so that you can continue to make a splash in the social media world. Until then, use these resources to make sure that you’re at the top of your game on Pinterest!
