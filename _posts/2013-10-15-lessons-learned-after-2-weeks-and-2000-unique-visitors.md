Our brand, INFINITUS, launched two weeks ago and we’ve already learned a lot from the 2,000+ visitors on the new site and interacting with hundreds of people across the globe. We’re big on learning - it’s how we produce great results for our clients.

**FIRST: Change Fast**

When something doesn’t work, change it fast, measure it, and adapt. In the first few days using tracking software we realized a few things:  

1. Our ["team" page"](/team) wasn’t working. Our conversion rate on our team page was terrible. We got some flack from our "cute" team member titles and even had someone blog about it.. (or at least we think they did). We don’t advocate for changing something just because some people have an opinion about it, but it was something that we didn’t feel strongly either way. We’re also working on adding more visuals and information to the page. 

2. People wanted to click on things that they couldn’t. For some reason 37 people tried to click on the word, "cheesecake" on our [contact page](/contact)… so, we’re adding a link to a delicious family [cheesecake recipe](/cheesecake-recipe). People wanted to be able to use the site in ways we never imagined they would.

**SECOND: Photography Matters**

In honesty, we didn’t put as much thought into our photography as we should of. Some of our best case studies didn’t get clicked on because we didn’t establish an emotional connection with the brand imagery. We changed it, and it’s increased our conversion rate. 

**THIRD: Leverage social proof**

We are lucky to have supporters across the world. We had shares, re-tweets, favorites, 1+’s and every other social high five you could get. We chose to launch on Twitter, Facebook, G+ and Linkedin, with different messages geared towards different audiences, and it generated hundreds of visits on our site. 

To encourage people to share our content, we personally reached out to friends and clients before the big launch day. We also aimed to create valuable content for the site from the beginning - it launched with 4 helpful blog articles and a free report download, the 6 Keys to Online Success in 2014 (if you want to get your hands on the report, just enter your email address in the footer). 

**FOURTH: Don’t underestimate**

Your extended network and supporters want to know what you’re up to - we’re all naturally curious. We’re so thankful for the amount of support that we’ve had, interviews with various media agencies, and to be featured on television. We expected that we would create a little buzz, but we believe we created a splash. 

After seeing the amount of traffic to the site, we were very glad that we waited for the site to look its very best before launch day. It took some long nights making tweaks to the design and content, but we were able to put a great foot forward from the beginning.
 
All in all, we’d like to thank everyone for a great few weeks. Hopefully you can learn a little from our launch experience. If you’d like to get more business, marketing & technology tips, sign up for our email list below to get email updates (and the free report)!
