In this edition of the Limitless Business Podcast, Scott Oldford and Kaye Putnam from [@GoInfinitus](http://twitter.com/goinfinitus) chat to two great guests on their subjects of law and outsourcing, with heaps of ways for you to look at both with fresh eyes.

Mandy Woodland is part of a growing movement of ‘alt-law’ lawyers turning around the way businesses pay for their legal services; she’s on your side. After this podcast she might have lots of new clients but she’ll have upset quite a few lawyers too. As well as explaining how this new model works to help you negotiate lower fees, she also shares great thoughts on how businesses are being caught out online as the digital world alters legal requirements.

Then we hear from Nick Loper, always hustling at sidehustlenation.com to make the most of your time and make you more profitable. He speaks on the benefits and challenges of outsourcing and shares tips on time saving tools from his new book “Work Smarter: 350+ Online Resources Today's Top Entrepreneurs Use To Increase Productivity and Achieve Their Goals”. It may be a long title, but this podcast conversation is a short route to get inside his head.

**In the interview with Mandy Woodland you’ll discover (amongst other things…):**
  
- The traditional ‘big law’ model is being broken down as technology allows business owners to be more law savvy.
- ’Alt law’ or ‘new law’ professionals, amongst other things, offer fixed fee support instead of hourly billing giving the business owner more control of their budget.
- Technology is giving people more information. You can now research a legal area and then approach a lawyer for confirmation or to look at what you’ve done yourself.
- If you pay for an online template, it’s worth getting a lawyer to review it to give you protection.
- Beware of doing your own template legal work as often the jurisdiction is wrong; it changes from state to state, country to country.
- When starting a business with other people, really write down clearly the responsibilities and the outcomes, whether the business be a success or a failure in the future it can make a difference.
- A local business starting to build an online presence has many things to consider including trademarks and privacy/data protection. Get a lawyer in to help early on and save a hefty bill and heartache later.
- It’s worth having legal systems in place to deal with your social media to protect your company from those managing it for you should something go wrong.
- Do a yearly check of all your legal documents and make sure they’re all still applicable.
- Mandy calls another option ‘Outhouse Counselling’ - like having an in-house lawyer, but they don’t sit in-house so you don’t have the overheads but you do have many of the benefits.
- You don’t have to rewrite the rule book to disrupt an industry, you can start by changing just one thing.

**In the interview with Nick Loper you’ll learn**
  
- That ‘outsourcing’ shouldn’t be a dirty word: we all outsource everyday if we use a dishwasher or washing machine!
- Outsourcing can help delegate tasks to allow you to concentrate on what you do best.
- Outsourcing can help a business scale up using the best people from anywhere in the world.
- The biggest challenge when outsourcing is communication.
- When starting a project, be detailed in your spec brief so there’s no confusion as to what is expected. Other than saving time and hassle later on, it could save you money as well.
- Invest time in training your outsourced talent upfront - in the long run you free up far more time for yourself.
- The dentist is the master of outsource. He brings it people to book his time, schedule it, deal with menial parts of the dentistry process and instead works on the high skilled elements that only he can deal with and that bring in most money.
- Be alert to the warning signs of an outsourced talent not being good enough: if they’re missing deadlines or making mistakes early on for example.
- Nick’s new book: “Work Smarter: 350+ Online Resources Today's Top Entrepreneurs Use To Increase Productivity and Achieve Their Goals” has an incredibly self explanatory title, so we’ll leave this note here, you can see why you’d want to take a look.
