Imagine a store with a counter in the back. A customer walks through the displays and rows of products and stands at the counter, waiting to be acknowledged. The associate behind the cash register stands there too, staring through the customer. After a few painfully awkward, seconds the customer turns around and walks out of the store.

Sounds ridiculous, right? If you were behind the counter, you would have been pleasant and kind to that potential customer. You would have given them world-class treatment as you do with every customer!

So, why aren’t you treating your online customers that way? If you have a website that isn’t optimized for mobile, if it’s outdated, or if you aren’t ready for eCommerce, you are the sales associate staring through customers. They’re on your website; they want to interact with you. But… you’re just not paying attention to them. 
 
**Optimize for Mobile**<br/>
If you haven’t thought about the way your website looks like on a mobile device, you need to now. Chances are someone is looking at your site right now on smartphone… and they probably have clicked out of it.  50% of all smartphone users use their phone as their primary source of internet and 57% of people polled have said that they won’t recommend a business if they have a badly [designed mobile site](http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2013-mobile-growth-statistics/).  That’s a lot of people you’re accidentally ignoring with a website that doesn’t load, loads slowly, or loads poorly on a phone.  (And if you’re not convinced yet, research suggests that for online-only stores, a [mobile-friendly website increases engagement by 85%](http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/infographic-2013-mobile-growth-statistics/).)  

**Update Your Outdated Website**<br/>
Remember the age of Geocities and Angel?  We do too… barely. That was 15 years ago!  A lot has changed since the early days of HTML. If your site hasn’t stayed current and still looks like it’s from the early 2000’s or—gasp—the late 1990’s, you need to rethink your website strategy now.

Your website might not be efficient, but more important is what it’s saying about your brand. Think objectively about your site:  How is your brand’s narrative being conveyed and changed by your website? Does your business look old, outdated, and tired? Or does it look cutting-edge and confident? Even small changes to fonts, color schemes, and photos can make a big difference and go a long way in promoting the image you want to craft.

**Take the eCommerce Plunge**<br/>
eCommerce isn’t the wave of the future; it’s the here-and-now. It’s projected that consumers will spend [$262 billion dollars online in the coming year](https://www.internetretailer.com/2013/03/13/us-e-commerce-grow-13-2013). If you haven’t included eCommerce to your marketing strategy, you’re missing out on your slice of those billions. There’s a lot to think about when it comes to eCommerce—logistics, supply chain, shipping—but it’s worthwhile to think about.  Online sales opens the world to your business and gives your customers (who are already looking at your site from across the country… or across the world) the accessibility they need to easily purchase your products.
