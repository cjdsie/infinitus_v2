We have a fondness for the 90’s. After all, the decade brought us Surge, boy bands, Lisa Frank TrapperKeepers, and dial-up internet access. Who will ever forget Titanic or Adam Sandler?  It was a pretty boss decade.

But times have evolved, and believe it or not, the ‘90’s happened 20 years ago. You know that, I know that… but does your website know that? Take a good, long look at it. If you’ve got the sneaking suspicion that your website is still partying like it’s 1999, we’ve got some work to do!
 
**Lose the Notices**<br>
Remember Geocities and the little construction GIFs that used to adorn websites that weren’t finished? Then, it was a show of status! Now… it’s just an annoyance. If your website has a “Coming Soon” or “Pardon Our Dust” message on any of your pages, take action now. Take those pages offline or get something up on them stat. Not only are those messages now cheesy and out-of-date, they’re also hurting your SEO ranking and driving away potential customers. 

**Optimize for Mobile**<br>
In the ‘90s, we were all excited about cordless phones-- who could have imagined that we would be spending so much time on them now?  (Not to mention that we’d be able to surf the internet on them!) We’ve given you the stats before about internet use on [mobile devices](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/stop-ignoring-your-customers), and they’re staggering. The bottom line is, if your website is not optimized for mobile use, that needs to be your number one priority. 

**Be Discerning About Design**<br>
We’re not sure why, but the 90’s seemed to be the time when everyone loved Comic Sans and other hard-to-read fonts. Likewise, we were all so excited about clip art, webpages over used them. Now that websites have evolved, it’s important to have a clean, accessible site. Ditch the crazy fonts and wacky clip art. Instead, invest in stunning pictures and professional fonts.

**Pick a Better URL**<br>
Do you have the sneaking suspicion that your current and possibly new customers can’t find you online easily? It might be your URL’s fault! If you have a URL that is difficult and too long for your clientele to remember, you could be missing out on valuable sales and traffic. We strongly suggest you consider migrating your website to a more intuitive, accurate address for your business.

The 1990’s were great-- and we still want a can of Surge from time to time--. but the truth of the matter is that technology has evolved for the better! And perhaps one of the best things about the here-and-now is that we’re here for you! If you’re not sure what the first step in getting your website ready for mobile devices is, or if you’re afraid that you’ll accidentally delete your site while moving it to another URL, or if you don’t have the time or manpower to get it done, we can help! We specialize in optimizing your brand and business so that you’re able to take full advantage of what today’s technology holds!
