**How can I optimize my account for maximum impact?**<br>
Let’s start with your profile. Is your profile picture something recognizable and specific to your brand, like a clear picture of your logo? Does your username make sense for your brand (ie. Is it something that people will be able to find, like @infinitus or @goinfinitus?)? Have you linked your business’ website to your profile? Is there a succinct description of your brand so that people who are searching or unfamiliar with you can find and connect with you?

**Does the app work on computers?**<br>
The app is created to be an on-the-go, spontaneous way of sharing the moments of life. You can view, comment, and like pictures as well as follow accounts on a computer, but you’ll have to upload your photos through the app on a tablet or mobile phone.  

**Who should I follow?**<br>
Do you have certain followers who you’ve marked as “tastemakers” or who are vigorously interested in your brand? These are users who tag your business in photos that are appropriate to your brand. For example, bloggers who have received and reviewed your products and have posted photos of your products on Instagram are great people to follow. They’ll be more inclined to continue posting excellent content and feel a bond with your brand if they are being validated and not ignored. 

You might also want to follow businesses and leaders that are specific to your industry or to your location. For example, it’s smart to follow the businesses who you share a block with or do business with. It’s also smart to follow the brands that you look up to. Share the love and keep an eye on what the bigger fish are up to!

**What if I come across unflattering pictures or reviews of my brand or product?**<br>
Instagram is just like any other social media platform. You’re going to have a ton of people who love your product and want to interact with you… but there will also be those who have an axe to grind. Don’t worry, though-- we’ve got you covered. Read our in-depth article on responding to bad reviews [here](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/what-to-do-with-bad-reviews).

**What should I post?**<br>
Use your best judgment when it comes to Instagram -- just as you would with any other social media platform. You might be tempted to flood the newsfeed with a lot of photographs at first. Instead, be discerning. Make sure that your pictures are clear and that your captions are well written. Remember, each photograph and caption helps to craft the narrative of your brand. Add to your business’ story with each post.

So, what other burning questions do you have? What perplexes you when it comes to using Instagram for your business? What other information or resources do you need? We’d love to hear your questions and comments and offer our sage advice!
