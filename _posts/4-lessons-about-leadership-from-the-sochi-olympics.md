The Winter Olympics are here again with their pageantry and excitement. And of course, the Olympics wouldn’t be the same without the interesting stories—both touching and whacky—that captivate the world. But outside of the entertainment value, these stories can teach us quite a lot about leadership and overcoming obstacles.

**Roll with the Punches**
It was a failure of epic proportions: during the Opening Ceremonies, the fifth Olympic ring did not materialize in front of more than a billion viewers worldwide. While it became a punch-line on social media and late night talk shows, the rest of the ceremony was breathtaking and emotional and dwarfed the technical error. How do you deal with problems? What do you do when something doesn’t go your way?

**Always Remember What Matters** 
Two-time Canadian freestyle skiing gold medalist, Alex Bilodeau, has made it very public that his inspiration for training and performing is his older brother who has cerebral palsy. The pair could be seen celebrating after Bilodeau’s gold medal win at Sochi. What grounds you? How do you stay connected to those things that matter most?

**When It Seems Like You’re at a Dead End, Burst Through** 
Before the Olympics began, US Bobsledder Johnny Quinn found himself trapped in the bathroom after his hot shower had sealed the door to its frame. Without a phone or a way out, Quinn lowered his shoulder and smashed through the door. While it may have been a little overly dramatic, it’s a great reminder: when there’s an obstacle in your path, lower your shoulder. Apply extra pressure. Break through and into success. (Or at least, out of the bathroom.

**Know Which Sacrifices are Necessary to Make You Successful** 
Sage Kotsenburg forewent participating in the Opening Ceremonies so that he could rest and prepare for the snowboard slopestyle competition the next day. What a tough decision! But it paid off—a gold medal and a performance that will go down in history. What sacrifices are you making? Are they strategic and on the path to success? 

Sometime in the near future—or maybe even now—you’ll be faced with a situation that will require the grit of a champion. Summon that Olympic spirit and go for the gold!
