You might be familiar with the adage, “With great power comes great responsibility.” While you’ve heard it most recently uttered by Uncle Ben in the movie Spider-Man, the quote also works quite nicely when it comes to social media. Social media gives everyone the power to be heard and to reach out to people in ways that haven’t been possible before. But of course, the power to be seen and heard by everyone all over the world means that you have an acute responsibility to the way you represent your brand and use social media.

**Stop Using Industry-Specific Jargon**<br>
If your business caters to industry insiders, then ignore this piece of advice. Otherwise, listen up! You want to make sure that your social media presence is welcoming and interesting to your audience. If you’re using a lot of jargon that the average person won’t understand, find a way to communicate the same idea.

**Stop Flooding Feeds**<br>
More content output doesn’t necessarily mean more engagement and followers. If you post twenty times in a row in the space of a few hours, you’ll flood your followers’ feeds.  Not only will you annoy your audience, you might encourage some of them to report you as spam, which will have a negative effect on your account and your ability to reach your followers. Instead, spread your tweets, pins, and posts strategically throughout the day.
  
**Stop Constantly Being on Message**<br>
Yes, your social media is meant to promote your brand and your products. But you don’t need to push it on your audience at every turn. That gets boring, deadens the enthusiasm for your product, and encourages your audience to press “unlike,” “block,” or “hide.” You’ve worked so hard to get a great following—don’t alienate them now! Instead, think about what information you could share with your audience that [engages, entertains, and educates them](http://www.goinfinitus.com/myposts/the-3-es-of-content-marketing).

**Stop Being Needy**<br>
LIKE this status! SHARE this image! ENTER this contest! BUY this product! READ this post! Constantly asking your followers to do something that has no real value for them but all of the benefit for you is similar to constantly being on message—it gets boring and annoying fast. And it makes you look needy and whiny. Instead, invite your followers to participate by posing questions and generating great content. If you do that, people will naturally share it of their own volition.
