You’ve got the Twitter handle, you know what a hashtag is, and you can sling a RT with the best of them, but… There’s something missing. Maybe your tweets feel forced. Maybe you don’t know exactly what to talk about. Maybe it doesn’t feel like your followers are really listening or care what you have to say. Have no fear! You can turn this around and get your social media back on track with just a little targeted interaction, a solid understanding of your brand, and some elbow grease. How? You can start with these three steps!

**Don’t Always Talk about Yourself**<br/>
Ever been stuck at a party talking to someone who can’t stop talking… about how awesome they are? It might be interesting initially, but it very quickly becomes dull and you find yourself rolling your eyes when they leave to refill their drink.  You might even try to sneak off without them knowing. Don’t be that guy (or gal)! Don’t drive your followers away with constant tweets about your brand. Too many tweets just about your services and products can begin to seem a little aggressive or desperate. Of course you want to promote your brand, but your followers will bore and un-follow you if that’s all you ever tweet about. 

**Tweet and Retweet Relevant Info**<br/>
So, if you’re not going to tweet just about your brand, what are you going to also post about? Having a strong marketing strategy and a solid understanding of your brand is absolutely vital here. What kinds of things do your customers find interesting, humourous, and useful? What values, ideals, and ideas does your brand espouse? What’s your brand’s marketing tone? Know the answers to these questions and then find articles, pictures, and Twitter users who fit your brand’s profile. Tweet information that will intrigue your followers and retweet and interact with those users you’ve targeted.  By making your tweets more textured and interesting, you’re reinforcing your brand as a leader in your industry. Your followers will appreciate that.

**Interact One-on-One**<br/>
Whether you have 5 followers or 5,000, you’ve got to be personable and friendly. People crave interaction through social media and tend to think more positively of brands that acknowledge their followers. It may not be possible to respond to every tweet that comes your way, but try to demonstrate that you value your followers and customers by strategically replying and retweeting. It’s free publicity for you (after all, at the very least, they’ll retweet your reply to them), and it helps you keep a finger on the pulse of your customers. 140 characters can go a long way!

If all of this is seeming a little unruly, focus just on one aspect of your Twitter strategy. If your followers seem quiet, look at what you’re sending into the ether of the internet. Tweet a question or a quote, and see what the response is. If you have a lot of interaction already, make an effort to respond to and retweet messages that are positive and align with your brand. (If you’ve got negative responses, we’ve got another post for you about just that topic!) If your tweets seem bland, spice them up with other media to get the conversation started with your followers. But no matter what tack you take, remember that social media relies on connections, and building connections takes time. Don’t get frustrated. Just keep interacting and the followers will, well, follow!
