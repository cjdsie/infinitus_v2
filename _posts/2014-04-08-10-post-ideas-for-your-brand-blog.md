Unless you love writing, maintaining a blog for your business may feel like an arduous task. After all, if you wanted to be a writer, you’d be a writer, right? Still, a blog for a business generates leads and traffic— it should be an integral part of your brand’s marketing plan. (And, if you don’t have one, you should seriously consider it.)

If you’re coming up empty-handed and frustrated with your blog, here are ten ideas that will get you on the right foot and jumpstart your creativity:

1. Introduce a new product to your clientele. What makes it unique and interesting? What is its use? Why should people buy it?
2. Provide a how-to on the use of one of your products. Even better? Post a video along with the article showing the product in action.
3. Round up your favourite ideas centered on a particular topic from Pinterest. What interests your audience? What topics align with your brand?
4. Provide a behind-the-scenes look at an aspect of how business is done. How is your brand or organization unique?
5. Invite a guest writer who is known in your field to post. It will garner new views and widen your audience as well as help to create relationships between your brand and others.
6. Publish a recent, common customer question that relates to your brand and answer it.
7. Write about a recent event at your business. Drum up interested for your next event.
8. Is there a product of yours that is lagging in sales? Re-introduce it to your blog readers!
9. Think about how your brand fits into an upcoming holiday or season. Give your readers the jump and help them prepare.
10. Invite an employee to write a post. You’ll be surprised at the fresh ideas and creativity!

The trick is to make sure that your posts are authentic. Make sure they’re true to your brand and your vision.
