We love our clients. In a way that’s just shy of creepy. However, while we were racking our brains to figure out what to give them for gifts for Christmas, everything seemed a bit hollow. Fruit cake? Logo’d pens and swag? Flowers? A motivational poster? Eh….

Nothing seemed quite right. None of our well-meaning ideas captured the feeling of the season. 

So, in lieu of client gifts this year, we’re doing something different. We’re giving our clients’ gifts to someone else. For every tweet, RT & Facebook share with the hashtag **#limitlesschristmas**, we are donating $1 to charity (up to $2500). Help us by spreading the love and awareness for these causes this Christmas.

Here’s what each dollar can equate to:

1. 1/40 of a Turkey for a NL Food Bank
2. 1/41 Food for a hungry child in Bangladesh through Compassion Canada
3. 1/10 of a box of nails for Habitat for Humanity
4. 1/13 of a basket of food for a typhoon survivor in the Philippines through CARE
5. 1/25 of a Christmas gift for a local family’s children
6. 1/15 of a dish for a local family’s Christmas dinner

Visit [limitlesschristmas.com](http://limitlesschristmas.com) to tweet (or write your own and include the hashtag #limitlesschristmas).

So, clients, I hope you’ll still feel appreciated, fruitcake or not. I hope you’ll join us in spreading holiday cheer this Christmas season by sharing one of the messages below: 

**Our goal is 2500 shares before Christmas**. Please take a moment and share whichever message speaks to your heart. 

We hope that these messages across the interwebs will inspire others to consider giving this holiday season as well. After all, it is OUR world - and we all can make a difference if we choose to. 

*Fine Print Items: Only one share per person will count for the $1 donation. The maximum amount $2500. Include #limitlesschristmas in your tweet or Facebook share, so we can track them*
