		<p>Flow Consulting is a management consultant firm that is being launched by Jane (Pardy) Helleur and Jean Cook. They are business partners who came together, and wanted to rebrand their new collaborative practice. They did not have a website yet, so we needed to start from scratch. We conducted in-depth discovery sessions to craft their buyer personas, brand voice, and marketing message. From there, we created the full web copywriting and web design for their new brand.</p>
		<p>The main challenge of the project was the importance of conveying a feeling of total trust in the partners’ abilities to help influence strategic change and manage difficult challenges. We drew inspiration from nonprofit organizations and “cause” retail stores to instill a feeling of working together towards a greater cause.</p>
		<p>The responsive web design was created with an organic, natural feel to immerse the website viewer into the emotion behind their brand: helping organizations get unstuck by creating good flow - much like how a river flows.</p>
		<p>Flow Consulting has established a great brand in NL among their clients. They are beloved and respected for the work that they do and the value they deliver. We captured elements of that on the website in the copywriting, by including testimonials, and examples of the well-known clients that they have worked with in the past.</p>
		<p>We were honoured to work with Jane and Jean - their exceptional reputation for delivering value to their clients is something we are proud to have translated into an immersive digital experience.</p>
