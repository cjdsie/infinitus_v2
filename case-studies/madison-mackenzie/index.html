		<p>Madison Mackenzie sells home goods and decor items like bedding, curtains, and home accessories from two locations in Newfoundland, Canada. They recently started a new Shopify ecommerce store to sell their products online.</p>
		<p>They contacted us to execute a short holiday marketing campaign that included blogging, newsletters, Facebook management, Pinterest, and digital advertising.</p>
		<p>We started by giving the social media accounts and home page a visual and copywriting upgrade. From there, we created a dynamic content, social media, and advertising campaign.</p>
		<p>Overall, our campaign drove over 3,600 visits to the new digital store in 3 weeks. We grew the Facebook audience by 426 fans, from 1457 to 1883, and saw engagement as high as 33% on some days. Our average engagement during the campaign was 8% of the fan page audience.</p>
		<ul class="checkmark-list">
			<li> Our email newsletters received an incredible 39% open rate, with 9% click rate.</li>
			<li> One of the highlights of the campaign was a “pin to win” contest where over 300 of the store’s products were pinned</li>
			<li> Google Adwords was held steady at $1 CPC, during the busy holiday season</li>
			<li> Curated gift guides and collections for the site</li>
