		<p>Dawe’s Mechanical is a full-service mechanical contractor. Located in Grand Falls-Windsor, they provide products and services to residents of Central Newfoundland and contracting services all across the province. We designed their first site back in 2008, but since then they’ve added suppliers and have grown considerably. They wanted a website that was more modern and spoke to the family values they hold.</p>
		<p>The new site is responsive, and is rich with imagery of modern families enjoying the results of Dawe’s Mechanical services (plumbing, heating, ventilation, etc.). We love this example of our work, because it shows how any industry can come to life online.</p>
