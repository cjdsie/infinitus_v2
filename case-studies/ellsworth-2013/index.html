		<p>Ron Ellsworth recently won the election in the City of St. John for his bid to be the Deputy Mayor.</p>
		<p>We worked with him to translate his political message into a dynamic brand online. His website is state-of-the-art with social media integration, eNewsletter, bold design and responsive to mobile viewing and overall his campaign was build with all visitors in mind.</p>
		<p>St. John is a dynamic area. Although online marketing isn’t the only medium to promote a message, his integration of traditional and innovative marketing techniques made his campaign memorable. And, it worked; he’s now the Deputy Mayor.</p>
