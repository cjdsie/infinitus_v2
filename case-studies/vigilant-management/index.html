		<p>Vigilant Management is a new industrial and commercial project management firm. They work in an industry that is not very active online, so they saw the huge opportunity to own that space. Even though the business partners have marketing knowledge, they wanted expert team to translate their ideas into reality.</p>
		<p>After our discovery sessions, we identified the buyer persona and decision making process their potential clients go through before hiring a project management firm. We used that knowledge to create a website that speaks directly to their potential customers with every design and copywriting aspect.</p>
